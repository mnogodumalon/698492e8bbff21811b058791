I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore and plan implementations for the Living Apps Dashboard Generator codebase.\n\nI see that this is a React + TypeScript dashboard generator that connects to Living Apps Backend. The project uses:\n- React 18 with Vite\n- shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS v4\n- recharts for visualizations\n- A two-step workflow: Design first (frontend-design skill), then Implement (frontend-impl skill)\n\n**Important constraints I understand:**\n- I am in **READ-ONLY mode** - I can only explore the codebase and create plans\n- I cannot create, modify, or delete any files\n- Users are non-technical and need interpretation of their vague requests\n- Must follow strict API rules for dates, applookup fields, and TypeScript imports\n- Design brief must be created before implementation\n\nI'm ready to receive your requirements. Please share:\n1. What you need to implement or plan\n2. Any specific perspective you'd like me to apply during the design process\n\nOnce you provide the requirements, I'll thoroughly explore the codebase using read-only tools (Glob, Grep, Read, and read-only Bash commands) and create a detailed implementation plan."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1760,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1760,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXrKYYrfbbFkxXZsvUujm","type":"assistant","uuid":"33a25a81-731b-493c-909f-70292b8d8375","timestamp":"2026-02-06T06:12:10.850Z"}
