Your goal is to create dashboards that feel like **top-rated apps from the App Store** - polished, intuitive, and memorable.\n\nYour output is `design_brief.md` - a detailed, written specification that the implementation agent will follow exactly.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Why Markdown, Not JSON\n\nYou write a **design brief** in Markdown because:\n\n1. **Explains WHY** - You can explain your reasoning, which helps the implementer understand intent\n2. **Reads as instructions** - The implementer treats it as guidance, not just data\n3. **Allows nuance** - You can describe visual details that don't fit in JSON fields\n4. **Prevents misinterpretation** - Explicit descriptions leave no room for \"creative interpretation\"\n\n---\n\n## Design Standard: App Store Quality\n\nYour designs must meet the quality bar of **the best apps in the App Store**:\n\n- **Layouts that feel native** to each device (not just \"responsive\")\n- **Information architecture** that makes sense instantly\n- **Touch targets and interactions** designed for each platform\n- **Visual hierarchy** that guides the eye naturally\n- **Distinctive details** that make the app memorable\n\nAsk yourself: **\"Would Apple feature this in the App Store?\"** If no, redesign.\n\n---\n\n## Theme: Light, Minimal, BUT Distinctive\n\n**Always use light mode.** But minimal does NOT mean generic or boring.\n\n### The Balance\n\n- **Minimalist** - Every element has a purpose, no clutter\n- **Modern** - Clean lines, subtle shadows, refined typography\n- **Neutral** - Calm, professional base\n- **BUT Distinctive** - One or two memorable details that make it special\n\n### What Makes a Minimal Design Distinctive?\n\nGreat minimal apps have subtle touches that create personality:\n\n1. **A refined color accent** - Not generic blue, but a carefully chosen tone\n2. **Thoughtful typography** - Font weight, size, and spacing that feels considered\n3. **Subtle texture or depth** - Light gradients, gentle shadows, or background patterns\n4. **Micro-details** - Icon style, border radius, spacing rhythm\n5. **Intentional white space** - Not just \"empty\" but compositionally balanced\n\n### Color Philosophy for Light Theme\n\nStart with a warm or cool base, not pure white:\n- **Warm base**: Off-white with slight cream/yellow undertone\n- **Cool base**: Off-white with slight blue/gray undertone\n\nThen add ONE carefully chosen accent color:\n- Not generic blue (#007bff) or green (#28a745)\n- Pick a specific, refined tone that fits the app's domain\n- Use sparingly - accent highlights important elements\n\n### Typography Philosophy\n\n**FORBIDDEN FONTS:** Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Arial, Helvetica, system-ui\n\nThese fonts are so common they signal \"no design thought went into this.\"\n\n**Choose fonts that add character while remaining readable:**\n\n| App Character | Recommended Fonts |\n|--------------|-------------------|\n| Data/Analytics | Space Grotesk, IBM Plex Sans, Geist |\n| Fitness/Health | Outfit, Nunito Sans, DM Sans |\n| Finance | Source Serif 4, Newsreader, IBM Plex Serif |\n| Creative | Syne, Bricolage Grotesque, Cabinet Grotesk |\n| Professional | Source Sans 3, Plus Jakarta Sans, Manrope |\n\n**Typography creates hierarchy through:**\n- Extreme weight differences (300 vs 700, not 400 vs 500)\n- Size jumps (24px vs 14px, not 16px vs 14px)\n- Careful letter-spacing adjustments\n\n---\n\n## Layout Design (MOST IMPORTANT!)\n\nLayout is the foundation of good UX. Spend the most time here.\n\n**⚠️ The #1 reason dashboards look like \"AI slop\" is a boring, symmetrical grid layout.** Real designers create visual tension and flow. Your layout must feel hand-crafted by a senior product designer for THIS specific app.\n\n### Think Like a Product Designer\n\nBefore drawing anything, answer:\n\n1. **What is the ONE thing users must see first?**\n   - This becomes your hero element - the visual anchor\n   - Everything else supports this\n\n2. **What actions do users take most often?**\n   - The #1 action becomes your Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n   - Maximum 1-2 taps/clicks to reach\n   - Position for thumb reach on mobile\n   - This dashboard is interactive, NOT read-only!\n\n3. **What is the user's mental model?**\n   - How do they naturally think about this data?\n   - Your layout should mirror their thinking\n\n4. **What is the user's workflow?**\n   - What sequence of actions do they take?\n   - How can the layout support this flow?\n\n---\n\n### Creating Visual Interest\n\nThe goal is a layout that feels **intentionally designed for THIS app**, not a generic template.\n\n**The core principle:** Every layout needs at least ONE element that creates visual interest - something that breaks the monotony of identical boxes. This could be:\n\n- **Size variation** - One element noticeably larger than others (the hero)\n- **Weight variation** - Mix of bold and subtle elements\n- **Spacing variation** - Tighter grouping within sections, more space between\n- **Format variation** - Mix of cards, inline text, badges (not everything in cards)\n- **Typography variation** - Different sizes that create clear hierarchy\n\n### Symmetric vs Asymmetric Layouts\n\n**Both can work well.** Choose based on what suits the app:\n\n**Symmetric layouts work when:**\n- The app has 2-4 equally important metrics\n- The data is naturally balanced (e.g., income vs expenses)\n- A calm, orderly feel fits the app's purpose\n\n**Asymmetric layouts work when:**\n- There's ONE thing that matters most (clear hero)\n- You want to create visual flow/movement\n- The data has natural hierarchy\n\n**Either way, add visual interest:**\n- If symmetric: vary element sizes, use different treatments for hero\n- If asymmetric: make the hierarchy obvious through sizing\n\n### What Makes a Layout Feel Generic\n\nAvoid these patterns that scream \"AI-generated template\":\n\n- **Everything the same size** - All KPIs identical, all cards identical\n- **No clear hero** - Nothing stands out as most important\n- **Uniform spacing everywhere** - No visual grouping\n- **Only cards** - No inline elements, no variation in container styles\n- **No breathing room** - Elements crammed together without whitespace\n\n### Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\nDesign mobile as a **completely separate experience**, not a squeezed desktop.\n\n**Mobile Principles:**\n- **Vertical flow** - One column, top to bottom\n- **Thumb-friendly** - Important actions in bottom half\n- **Focused** - Show less, but show it well\n- **Progressive** - Reveal details on interaction\n- **Hero stands out** - Make the most important element visually dominant\n\n**Mobile Questions:**\n- What needs to be LARGER for comfortable touch?\n- Where should the primary action live? (Thumb zone)\n- How does the hero stand out from other content?\n- How should content be reorganized to fit the vertical flow?\n\nNote: Only hide elements on mobile if they're truly impossible to use on a phone. Users expect the same functionality on all devices.\n\n**Mobile Layout Ideas:**\n- Hero KPI takes entire top fold, everything else scrolls below\n- Compact horizontal scroll for secondary KPIs\n- Inline summary row (not cards) for quick stats\n- Bottom sheet for additional details\n\n### Desktop Layout\n\nDesign desktop to take full advantage of horizontal space.\n\n**Desktop Principles:**\n- **Use the width** - Multi-column layouts where appropriate\n- **Horizontal density** - Side-by-side information\n- **Hover reveals** - Secondary info on hover\n- **Peripheral vision** - Context without overwhelming\n- **Keyboard awareness** - Power user shortcuts\n\n**Desktop Questions:**\n- How does the extra width add value? (Not just stretching)\n- Which side gets the hero element?\n- What information benefits from side-by-side comparison?\n- What hover states add useful information?\n- Where can you break the grid intentionally?\n\n**Desktop Layout Ideas:**\n- Wide left column (hero + chart) + narrow right column (recent activity)\n- Full-width hero banner, then 3 unequal columns below\n- Sidebar with key stats, main area with detailed views\n- Sticky summary header while scrolling through details\n\n---\n\n## Information Hierarchy\n\nUsers scan, they don't read. Design for scanning.\n\n**Hierarchy Levels:**\n1. **Primary** - ONE thing that matters most (largest, boldest)\n2. **Secondary** - Supporting information (medium)\n3. **Tertiary** - Details, metadata (smallest, muted)\n\n**Hierarchy Tools:**\n- Size (larger = more important)\n- Weight (bolder = more important)\n- Color (accent = important/interactive)\n- Position (top/left = seen first)\n- Space (more whitespace = more important)\n\n---\n\n## Your Output: design_brief.md\n\nWrite a detailed design brief in Markdown.

What proportions?\n- Where does the eye go first, second, third?\n- What creates visual interest in this layout?]\n\n### Section Layout\n[Describe what goes where:\n- Top area: [what content]\n- Main content area: [what content]\n- Supporting areas: [what content]\nInclude proportions if using multi-column layout.]\n\n### What Appears on Hover\n[What extra information is revealed when hovering over elements?]\n\n### Clickable/Interactive Areas (if applicable)\n[If any elements should open detail views when clicked, note them here.\nOnly add where it provides additional useful information.]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Components\n\n### Hero KPI\nThe MOST important metric that users see first.\n\n- **Title:** [Name]\n- **Data source:** [Which app to query]\n- **Calculation:** [How to calculate: sum, count, latest, etc.]\n- **Display:** [How it looks - large number? With icon? Progress ring?]\n- **Context shown:** [What comparison? Goal progress? Trend?]\n- **Why this is the hero:** [Explain why this matters most to users]\n\n### Secondary KPIs\n[For each secondary KPI:]\n\n**[KPI Name]**\n- Source: [App]\n- Calculation: [How]\n- Format: [number/currency/percent]\n- Display: [Card? Inline? Size?]\n\n### Chart (if applicable)\n- **Type:** [line/bar/area - and WHY this type]\n- **Title:** [Chart title]\n- **What question it answers:** [Why does the user need this chart?]\n- **Data source:** [App]\n- **X-axis:** [Field, label]\n- **Y-axis:** [Field, label]\n- **Mobile simplification:** [How is it simplified for small screens?]\n\n### Lists/Tables (if applicable)\n[For each list:]\n\n**[Section Name]**\n- Purpose: [Why users need this]\n- Source: [App]\n- Fields shown: [Which fields]\n- Mobile style: [cards/simple list]\n- Desktop style: [table/cards]\n- Sort: [By what field]\n- Limit: [How many items]\n\n### Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n\n**⚠️ Every dashboard MUST have a primary action.** This is NOT a read-only view!\n\nUsers need to DO things from the dashboard, not just look at data. The most common action should be one tap/click away.\n\nThink about what action users perform most often:\n- Adding a new record (workout, meal, expense, etc.)\n- Logging something (weight, progress, status)\n- Starting a process (timer, session, etc.)\n\n**This section is REQUIRED - do not skip it or write \"None\"!**\n\n- **Label:** [Action-oriented text, e.g. \"Workout starten\", \"Mahlzeit hinzufügen\"]\n- **Action:** [add_record | navigate - specify which]\n- **Target app:** [Which Living Apps app receives the data]\n- **What data:** [What fields will the form contain]\n- **Mobile position:** [bottom_fixed (recommended) | header | fab]\n- **Desktop position:** [header | sidebar | inline]\n- **Why this action:** [Why is this the most important thing users do?]\n\nThe implementation skill knows how to create forms that send data to Living Apps API.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Visual Details\n\n### Border Radius\n[sharp (4px) / rounded (8px) / pill (16px+)]\n\n### Shadows\n[none / subtle / elevated - describe the shadow style]\n\n### Spacing\n[compact / normal / spacious - how much breathing room?]\n\n### Animations\n- **Page load:** [none / fade / stagger]\n- **Hover effects:** [What happens on hover?]\n- **Tap feedback:** [What happens on tap?]\n\n---\n\n## 8. CSS Variables (Copy Exactly!)\n\nThe implementer MUST copy these values exactly into `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: hsl(...);\n  --foreground: hsl(...);\n  --card: hsl(...);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --popover: hsl(...);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --primary: hsl(...);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --secondary: hsl(...);\n  --secondary-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --muted: hsl(...);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --accent: hsl(...);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --destructive: hsl(...);\n  --border: hsl(...);\n  --input: hsl(...);\n  --ring: hsl(...);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. Implementation Checklist\n\nThe implementer should verify:\n- [ ] Font loaded from URL above\n- [ ] All CSS variables copied exactly\n- [ ] Mobile layout matches Section 4\n- [ ] Desktop layout matches Section 5\n- [ ] Hero element is prominent as described\n- [ ] Colors create the mood described in Section 2\n```\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ How Colors Are Applied (Critical!)\n\nYour colors are mapped to CSS variables. The implementation agent uses them directly.\n\n**Color Mapping:**\n\n| Your design_brief color | CSS Variable |\n|-------------------------|--------------|\n| `background` | `--background` |\n| `foreground` | `--foreground` |\n| `card` | `--card` |\n| `card_foreground` | `--card-foreground` |\n| `primary` | `--primary` |\n| `primary_foreground` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| `accent` | `--accent` |\n| `muted` | `--muted` |\n| `muted_foreground` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| `border` | `--border` |\n| `negative` | `--destructive` |\n\n**Light Theme Contrast Rules:**\n- `foreground` must be dark (readable on light backgrounds)\n- `card` can be white or slightly off-white\n- `card_foreground` must be dark\n- `primary` needs sufficient contrast for buttons\n\n**All colors MUST be complete hsl() functions:**\n```\n\"background\": \"hsl(40 20% 98%)\"   // ✅ Complete function\n\"background\": \"40 20% 98%\"        // ❌ Will break!\n```\n\n---\n\n## Quality Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing design_brief.md:\n\n### Distinctiveness\n- [ ] Would a designer recognize this as intentionally designed (not default)?\n- [ ] Is there at least ONE memorable visual detail?\n- [ ] Is the font choice appropriate and NOT from forbidden list?\n- [ ] Does the color accent feel considered, not generic?\n\n### Layout & UX (CRITICAL FOR AVOIDING AI SLOP!)\n- [ ] Is there ONE clear hero element that stands out?\n- [ ] Is there visual interest? (size variation, typography hierarchy, spacing variation)\n- [ ] NOT everything the same size - some variation exists\n- [ ] Is mobile designed FOR mobile (not just smaller)?\n- [ ] Does desktop use horizontal space meaningfully?\n- [ ] Would this get featured in the App Store?\n\n### Interactivity\n- [ ] Is the primary action clearly defined?\n- [ ] Are clickable elements marked where drill-down adds value?\n\n### Information\n- [ ] Is the visual hierarchy clear?\n- [ ] Are all relevant KPIs included?\n\n### Clarity\n- [ ] Is every section detailed enough that someone else could implement it?\n- [ ] Are there WHY explanations for major decisions?\n- [ ] Are the CSS variables complete and ready to copy?\n- [ ] Is the Layout Strategy section filled out with specific proportions?\n\n### Technical\n- [ ] Are all colors complete hsl() functions?\n- [ ] Is contrast sufficient for readability?\n- [ ] Are all required colors defined?\n\n---\n\n## Remember\n\n1. **Write for the implementer** - They will follow your words exactly\n2. **Explain WHY** - Context helps them understand intent\n3. **Be specific** - \"Large number\" is vague, \"48px bold\" is specific\n4. **Minimal ≠ Generic** - Minimal can be distinctive\n5. **Layout is everything** - 80% of design time on layout\n6. **Visual interest is required** - Vary sizes, not everything identical\n7. **Mobile ≠ Small Desktop** - Separate experiences\n8. **One memorable detail** - What makes this special?\n9. **App Store quality** - Would Apple feature this?\n","numLines":613,"startLine":1,"totalLines":613}}}

App Analysis\n\n### What This App Does\nThis is a personal health and nutrition diary that helps users track three interconnected aspects of their wellbeing: symptoms (like energy levels, mood, throat clearing, lymph swelling), eating habits, and medication intake. The core purpose is to help users identify patterns and correlations between what they eat, their medications, and how they feel.\n\n### Who Uses This\nHealth-conscious individuals managing chronic conditions, food sensitivities, or anyone wanting to understand how their diet and medications affect their symptoms. They're likely tracking this data to share with doctors or to identify triggers for symptoms. They're not tech-savvy - they just want a simple way to log their daily health data.\n\n### The ONE Thing Users Care About Most\n**\"Wie fühle ich mich heute?\"** (How am I feeling today?) - Users want to see their current symptom status at a glance, especially energy and mood levels, and quickly understand if today is a good or bad day compared to recent trends.\n\n### Primary Actions (IMPORTANT!)\n1. **Symptom erfassen** → Primary Action Button (most frequent action - users log symptoms multiple times daily)\n2. Mahlzeit hinzufügen (secondary - tracked at mealtimes)\n3. Medikament eintragen (less frequent - usually scheduled)\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Makes This Design Distinctive\n\n### Visual Identity\nThis design uses a **soft sage green and warm cream palette** that evokes healing, nature, and wellness. Unlike clinical health apps that feel sterile with blues and whites, this feels like a personal wellness journal - calming and encouraging. The warm cream background with subtle sage accents creates a nurturing environment that makes daily health tracking feel like self-care rather than a medical chore.\n\n### Layout Strategy\nThe layout is **asymmetric on desktop** with a dominant left column (60%) for the hero wellness score and symptom trends, and a narrower right column (40%) for recent activity. This creates visual hierarchy where wellness state is clearly primary.\n\nOn mobile, the layout uses **vertical stacking with dramatic size variation**: the hero section takes nearly 50% of the initial viewport with an oversized wellness indicator, making the most important information impossible to miss. Secondary stats are presented in a compact horizontal row, NOT as equal cards - they're supporting info, not competing heroes.\n\n### Unique Element\nThe **Wellness-Indikator** (Wellness Indicator) at the top uses a unique gradient arc that visualizes the average symptom score for today. The arc progresses from sage green (good) through warm yellow to a soft coral (needs attention). This arc wraps around a large number showing today's average score, making it feel almost game-like - encouraging users to \"improve their score\" by taking care of themselves.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Theme & Colors\n\n### Font\n- **Family:** DM Sans\n- **URL:** `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=DM+Sans:opsz,wght@9..40,300;9..40,400;9..40,500;9..40,600;9..40,700&display=swap`\n- **Why this font:** DM Sans has a warm, friendly personality that doesn't feel clinical. Its soft letter shapes with slightly rounded terminals feel approachable and caring - perfect for a personal health journal. The variable weight range allows for dramatic hierarchy between the large wellness number and smaller labels.\n\n### Color Palette\nAll colors as complete hsl() functions:\n\n| Purpose | Color | CSS Variable |\n|---------|-------|--------------|\n| Page background | `hsl(45 30% 97%)` | `--background` |\n| Main text | `hsl(150 15% 20%)` | `--foreground` |\n| Card background | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--card` |\n| Card text | `hsl(150 15% 20%)` | `--card-foreground` |\n| Borders | `hsl(150 15% 88%)` | `--border` |\n| Primary action (sage green) | `hsl(150 35% 45%)` | `--primary` |\n| Text on primary | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| Accent highlight | `hsl(150 30% 92%)` | `--accent` |\n| Muted background | `hsl(45 20% 94%)` | `--muted` |\n| Muted text | `hsl(150 10% 45%)` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| Success/positive (good symptoms) | `hsl(150 45% 45%)` | (component use) |\n| Warning (moderate symptoms) | `hsl(40 80% 55%)` | (component use) |\n| Error/negative (bad symptoms) | `hsl(10 60% 55%)` | `--destructive` |\n\n### Why These Colors\nThe sage green primary evokes natural healing and wellness without feeling clinical like medical blue. The warm cream background (not pure white) creates a cozy, journal-like feel. The color system for symptoms creates intuitive feedback: green is \"I feel good\", yellow is \"okay\", coral is \"needs attention\" - natural associations that require no learning.\n\n### Background Treatment\nThe background uses a very subtle warm cream (`hsl(45 30% 97%)`) rather than pure white, giving the entire app a gentle warmth. This is intentional - pure white can feel cold and clinical, while the warm cream feels like a wellness journal or spa environment.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\nDesign mobile as a COMPLETELY SEPARATE experience, not squeezed desktop.\n\n### Layout Approach\nThe mobile layout creates visual hierarchy through dramatic size variation. The wellness indicator hero dominates the top, with supporting metrics presented as compact inline elements rather than equal cards. This prevents the \"AI slop\" look of identical same-size boxes.\n\n### What Users See (Top to Bottom)\n\n**Header:**\n- Simple title \"Mein Tagebuch\" left-aligned\n- Small date \"Donnerstag, 5. Februar\" below in muted text\n- Clean, minimal - no icons or clutter\n\n**Hero Section (The FIRST thing users see):**\n- **What:** Today's average wellness score (calculated from symptom ratings, inverted so higher is better)\n- **How big:** Takes approximately 45% of the viewport height\n- **Styling:**\n  - Large circular progress arc (semi-circle, 180°) showing the wellness score\n  - Arc is 10px thick with rounded caps\n  - Color gradient from sage green (good, score 8-10) through warm yellow (moderate, 4-7) to soft coral (poor, 1-3)\n  - Inside the arc: the score number in 64px bold weight\n  - Below the number: small text \"von 10\" in muted color\n  - Beneath the arc: contextual text like \"Guter Tag!\" or \"Achte auf dich\" based on score\n- **Why this is the hero:** Users open the app to answer one question: \"How am I doing?\" This answers it instantly with a clear visual that requires no interpretation.\n\n**Section 2: Quick Stats Row**\n- A single horizontal row (not cards!) with 3 inline stats:\n  - Symptome heute: count of symptoms logged today\n  - Mahlzeiten: count of meals logged today\n  - Medikamente: count of medications logged today\n- Displayed as: icon + number + label, all inline, separated by subtle dividers\n- Small size (14px numbers, 12px labels) - these are supporting context, not competing heroes\n- This row answers \"What have I tracked today?\" at a glance\n\n**Section 3: Symptom-Trend (Chart)**\n- Title: \"Letzte 7 Tage\" in 16px medium weight\n- Area chart showing daily average symptom scores over the past week\n- Chart height: approximately 160px\n- X-axis: Day abbreviations (Mo, Di, Mi, Do, Fr, Sa, So)\n- Y-axis: hidden (implied 1-10 scale)\n- Fill: Soft sage green gradient with 20% opacity\n- Line: Solid sage green, 2px\n- This shows users their trend at a glance - are they improving or getting worse?\n\n**Section 4: Heutige Einträge (Today's Entries)**\n- Section title with a subtle \"Alle anzeigen\" text link on the right\n- Combined list of today's symptoms, meals, and medications\n- Each entry as a compact list item (NOT cards):\n  - Small colored dot on the left indicating type (sage=symptom, amber=meal, blue=medication)\n  - Time in muted text (e.g., \"14:30\")\n  - Description (e.g., \"Energie - Bewertung: 3\" or \"Mittagessen: Salat\")\n- Maximum 5 most recent entries shown\n- If empty: friendly message \"Noch keine Einträge heute. Starte mit deinem ersten Eintrag!\"\n\n**Bottom Navigation / Action:**\n- Fixed bottom bar with Primary Action Button\n- Button: Full-width sage green, rounded (12px radius), 56px tall\n- Label: \"Eintrag hinzufügen\" with a subtle + icon\n- Tapping opens a bottom sheet with 3 options: Symptom, Mahlzeit, Medikament\n- This ensures the primary action is always one tap away, in the thumb zone\n\n### Mobile-Specific Adaptations\n- Chart is simplified: no axis labels, just the visual trend line\n- Entry list shows abbreviated content to fit in single lines\n- Quick stats row uses icons prominently to save space\n- All touch targets are at least 44px\n\n### Touch Targets\n- Primary action button: 56px tall, full width\n- List items: 52px tall minimum\n- Quick stat items: tappable with 44px height\n\n### Interactive Elements\n- Tapping an entry in \"Heutige Einträge\" opens a detail sheet showing full entry with edit/delete options\n- Tapping the wellness indicator area scrolls to the trend chart\n- Tapping \"Alle anzeigen\" navigates to a full entry list\n\n---\n\n## 5. Desktop Layout\n\n### Overall Structure\nTwo-column asymmetric layout with a 60/40 split:\n- **Left column (60%):** Hero wellness indicator + trend chart + recent entries list\n- **Right column (40%):** Quick add panel + stats breakdown + tips\n\nThe eye naturally flows: Wellness score (hero) → Trend chart → Recent activity, with the right column providing supporting context and quick actions.\n\n### Section Layout\n\n**Top Area (Spanning full width):**\n- Header bar with \"Mein Gesundheitstagebuch\" title on left\n- Date display on right\n- 80px padding top, 32px padding sides\n\n**Left Column - Main Content (60%):**\n\n1. **Hero Wellness Indicator:**\n   - Same semi-circle arc as mobile but larger (240px diameter)\n   - Score number in 72px bold\n   - Positioned top-left of the column with generous whitespace around it\n   - Contextual message beneath\n\n2. **Trend Chart:**\n   - Below the hero, full width of the column\n   - 200px height\n   - Shows 7-day trend with day labels visible\n   - Y-axis shows scale (1-10)\n   - Hover states show exact values per day\n\n3. **Recent Entries:**\n   - Table-style list with columns: Zeit | Typ | Beschreibung | Bewertung\n   - Shows last 10 entries across all types\n   - Alternating subtle row backgrounds for readability\n   - Sortable by clicking column headers\n\n**Right Column - Supporting Content (40%):**\n\n1. **Schnelleintrag Panel (Quick Add):**\n   - Card with three large buttons stacked vertically:\n     - \"Symptom erfassen\" (primary sage color)\n     - \"Mahlzeit hinzufügen\" (outlined)\n     - \"Medikament eintragen\" (outlined)\n   - Each button 52px tall with icon + label\n   - This puts actions always visible, not hidden in a FAB\n\n2. **Tagesübersicht Stats:**\n   - Card showing today's breakdown:\n     - Symptoms logged: X\n     - Durchschnittliche Bewertung: X.X\n     - Mahlzeiten: X\n     - Medikamente: X\n   - Each stat as a row with icon, label, and value\n\n3. **Symptom-Verteilung:**\n   - Small donut chart showing distribution of symptom types logged this week\n   - Legend showing: Energie, Stimmung, Räuspern, Lymphschwellung\n   - Helps users see what they track most\n\n### What Appears on Hover\n- Chart data points show tooltip with exact value and date\n- Entry rows highlight with slightly darker background\n- Entry rows show \"Bearbeiten\" and \"Löschen\" action icons on far right when hovered\n- Quick add buttons show subtle lift shadow\n\n### Clickable/Interactive Areas\n- Clicking an entry row opens an inline expansion showing full details and edit form\n- Clicking a symptom type in the donut chart filters the entry list to that type\n- Chart is interactive: clicking a day shows entries from that day\n\n---\n\n## 6. Components\n\n### Hero KPI: Wellness-Indikator\nThe MOST important metric that users see first.\n\n- **Title:** Wellness-Score\n- **Data source:** Symptomerfassung app\n- **Calculation:**\n  1.

App Analysis\n\n### What This App Does\nThis is a personal health and nutrition diary that helps users track three interconnected aspects of their wellbeing: symptoms (like energy levels, mood, throat clearing, lymph swelling), eating habits, and medication intake. The core purpose is to help users identify patterns and correlations between what they eat, their medications, and how they feel.\n\n### Who Uses This\nHealth-conscious individuals managing chronic conditions, food sensitivities, or anyone wanting to understand how their diet and medications affect their symptoms. They're likely tracking this data to share with doctors or to identify triggers for symptoms. They're not tech-savvy - they just want a simple way to log their daily health data.\n\n### The ONE Thing Users Care About Most\n**\"Wie fühle ich mich heute?\"** (How am I feeling today?) - Users want to see their current symptom status at a glance, especially energy and mood levels, and quickly understand if today is a good or bad day compared to recent trends.\n\n### Primary Actions (IMPORTANT!)\n1. **Symptom erfassen** → Primary Action Button (most frequent action - users log symptoms multiple times daily)\n2. Mahlzeit hinzufügen (secondary - tracked at mealtimes)\n3. Medikament eintragen (less frequent - usually scheduled)\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Makes This Design Distinctive\n\n### Visual Identity\nThis design uses a **soft sage green and warm cream palette** that evokes healing, nature, and wellness. Unlike clinical health apps that feel sterile with blues and whites, this feels like a personal wellness journal - calming and encouraging. The warm cream background with subtle sage accents creates a nurturing environment that makes daily health tracking feel like self-care rather than a medical chore.\n\n### Layout Strategy\nThe layout is **asymmetric on desktop** with a dominant left column (60%) for the hero wellness score and symptom trends, and a narrower right column (40%) for recent activity. This creates visual hierarchy where wellness state is clearly primary.\n\nOn mobile, the layout uses **vertical stacking with dramatic size variation**: the hero section takes nearly 50% of the initial viewport with an oversized wellness indicator, making the most important information impossible to miss. Secondary stats are presented in a compact horizontal row, NOT as equal cards - they're supporting info, not competing heroes.\n\n### Unique Element\nThe **Wellness-Indikator** (Wellness Indicator) at the top uses a unique gradient arc that visualizes the average symptom score for today. The arc progresses from sage green (good) through warm yellow to a soft coral (needs attention). This arc wraps around a large number showing today's average score, making it feel almost game-like - encouraging users to \"improve their score\" by taking care of themselves.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Theme & Colors\n\n### Font\n- **Family:** DM Sans\n- **URL:** `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=DM+Sans:opsz,wght@9..40,300;9..40,400;9..40,500;9..40,600;9..40,700&display=swap`\n- **Why this font:** DM Sans has a warm, friendly personality that doesn't feel clinical. Its soft letter shapes with slightly rounded terminals feel approachable and caring - perfect for a personal health journal. The variable weight range allows for dramatic hierarchy between the large wellness number and smaller labels.\n\n### Color Palette\nAll colors as complete hsl() functions:\n\n| Purpose | Color | CSS Variable |\n|---------|-------|--------------|\n| Page background | `hsl(45 30% 97%)` | `--background` |\n| Main text | `hsl(150 15% 20%)` | `--foreground` |\n| Card background | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--card` |\n| Card text | `hsl(150 15% 20%)` | `--card-foreground` |\n| Borders | `hsl(150 15% 88%)` | `--border` |\n| Primary action (sage green) | `hsl(150 35% 45%)` | `--primary` |\n| Text on primary | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| Accent highlight | `hsl(150 30% 92%)` | `--accent` |\n| Muted background | `hsl(45 20% 94%)` | `--muted` |\n| Muted text | `hsl(150 10% 45%)` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| Success/positive (good symptoms) | `hsl(150 45% 45%)` | (component use) |\n| Warning (moderate symptoms) | `hsl(40 80% 55%)` | (component use) |\n| Error/negative (bad symptoms) | `hsl(10 60% 55%)` | `--destructive` |\n\n### Why These Colors\nThe sage green primary evokes natural healing and wellness without feeling clinical like medical blue. The warm cream background (not pure white) creates a cozy, journal-like feel. The color system for symptoms creates intuitive feedback: green is \"I feel good\", yellow is \"okay\", coral is \"needs attention\" - natural associations that require no learning.\n\n### Background Treatment\nThe background uses a very subtle warm cream (`hsl(45 30% 97%)`) rather than pure white, giving the entire app a gentle warmth. This is intentional - pure white can feel cold and clinical, while the warm cream feels like a wellness journal or spa environment.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\nDesign mobile as a COMPLETELY SEPARATE experience, not squeezed desktop.\n\n### Layout Approach\nThe mobile layout creates visual hierarchy through dramatic size variation. The wellness indicator hero dominates the top, with supporting metrics presented as compact inline elements rather than equal cards. This prevents the \"AI slop\" look of identical same-size boxes.\n\n### What Users See (Top to Bottom)\n\n**Header:**\n- Simple title \"Mein Tagebuch\" left-aligned\n- Small date \"Donnerstag, 5. Februar\" below in muted text\n- Clean, minimal - no icons or clutter\n\n**Hero Section (The FIRST thing users see):**\n- **What:** Today's average wellness score (calculated from symptom ratings, inverted so higher is better)\n- **How big:** Takes approximately 45% of the viewport height\n- **Styling:**\n  - Large circular progress arc (semi-circle, 180°) showing the wellness score\n  - Arc is 10px thick with rounded caps\n  - Color gradient from sage green (good, score 8-10) through warm yellow (moderate, 4-7) to soft coral (poor, 1-3)\n  - Inside the arc: the score number in 64px bold weight\n  - Below the number: small text \"von 10\" in muted color\n  - Beneath the arc: contextual text like \"Guter Tag!\" or \"Achte auf dich\" based on score\n- **Why this is the hero:** Users open the app to answer one question: \"How am I doing?\" This answers it instantly with a clear visual that requires no interpretation.\n\n**Section 2: Quick Stats Row**\n- A single horizontal row (not cards!) with 3 inline stats:\n  - Symptome heute: count of symptoms logged today\n  - Mahlzeiten: count of meals logged today\n  - Medikamente: count of medications logged today\n- Displayed as: icon + number + label, all inline, separated by subtle dividers\n- Small size (14px numbers, 12px labels) - these are supporting context, not competing heroes\n- This row answers \"What have I tracked today?\" at a glance\n\n**Section 3: Symptom-Trend (Chart)**\n- Title: \"Letzte 7 Tage\" in 16px medium weight\n- Area chart showing daily average symptom scores over the past week\n- Chart height: approximately 160px\n- X-axis: Day abbreviations (Mo, Di, Mi, Do, Fr, Sa, So)\n- Y-axis: hidden (implied 1-10 scale)\n- Fill: Soft sage green gradient with 20% opacity\n- Line: Solid sage green, 2px\n- This shows users their trend at a glance - are they improving or getting worse?\n\n**Section 4: Heutige Einträge (Today's Entries)**\n- Section title with a subtle \"Alle anzeigen\" text link on the right\n- Combined list of today's symptoms, meals, and medications\n- Each entry as a compact list item (NOT cards):\n  - Small colored dot on the left indicating type (sage=symptom, amber=meal, blue=medication)\n  - Time in muted text (e.g., \"14:30\")\n  - Description (e.g., \"Energie - Bewertung: 3\" or \"Mittagessen: Salat\")\n- Maximum 5 most recent entries shown\n- If empty: friendly message \"Noch keine Einträge heute. Starte mit deinem ersten Eintrag!\"\n\n**Bottom Navigation / Action:**\n- Fixed bottom bar with Primary Action Button\n- Button: Full-width sage green, rounded (12px radius), 56px tall\n- Label: \"Eintrag hinzufügen\" with a subtle + icon\n- Tapping opens a bottom sheet with 3 options: Symptom, Mahlzeit, Medikament\n- This ensures the primary action is always one tap away, in the thumb zone\n\n### Mobile-Specific Adaptations\n- Chart is simplified: no axis labels, just the visual trend line\n- Entry list shows abbreviated content to fit in single lines\n- Quick stats row uses icons prominently to save space\n- All touch targets are at least 44px\n\n### Touch Targets\n- Primary action button: 56px tall, full width\n- List items: 52px tall minimum\n- Quick stat items: tappable with 44px height\n\n### Interactive Elements\n- Tapping an entry in \"Heutige Einträge\" opens a detail sheet showing full entry with edit/delete options\n- Tapping the wellness indicator area scrolls to the trend chart\n- Tapping \"Alle anzeigen\" navigates to a full entry list\n\n---\n\n## 5. Desktop Layout\n\n### Overall Structure\nTwo-column asymmetric layout with a 60/40 split:\n- **Left column (60%):** Hero wellness indicator + trend chart + recent entries list\n- **Right column (40%):** Quick add panel + stats breakdown + tips\n\nThe eye naturally flows: Wellness score (hero) → Trend chart → Recent activity, with the right column providing supporting context and quick actions.\n\n### Section Layout\n\n**Top Area (Spanning full width):**\n- Header bar with \"Mein Gesundheitstagebuch\" title on left\n- Date display on right\n- 80px padding top, 32px padding sides\n\n**Left Column - Main Content (60%):**\n\n1. **Hero Wellness Indicator:**\n   - Same semi-circle arc as mobile but larger (240px diameter)\n   - Score number in 72px bold\n   - Positioned top-left of the column with generous whitespace around it\n   - Contextual message beneath\n\n2. **Trend Chart:**\n   - Below the hero, full width of the column\n   - 200px height\n   - Shows 7-day trend with day labels visible\n   - Y-axis shows scale (1-10)\n   - Hover states show exact values per day\n\n3. **Recent Entries:**\n   - Table-style list with columns: Zeit | Typ | Beschreibung | Bewertung\n   - Shows last 10 entries across all types\n   - Alternating subtle row backgrounds for readability\n   - Sortable by clicking column headers\n\n**Right Column - Supporting Content (40%):**\n\n1. **Schnelleintrag Panel (Quick Add):**\n   - Card with three large buttons stacked vertically:\n     - \"Symptom erfassen\" (primary sage color)\n     - \"Mahlzeit hinzufügen\" (outlined)\n     - \"Medikament eintragen\" (outlined)\n   - Each button 52px tall with icon + label\n   - This puts actions always visible, not hidden in a FAB\n\n2. **Tagesübersicht Stats:**\n   - Card showing today's breakdown:\n     - Symptoms logged: X\n     - Durchschnittliche Bewertung: X.X\n     - Mahlzeiten: X\n     - Medikamente: X\n   - Each stat as a row with icon, label, and value\n\n3. **Symptom-Verteilung:**\n   - Small donut chart showing distribution of symptom types logged this week\n   - Legend showing: Energie, Stimmung, Räuspern, Lymphschwellung\n   - Helps users see what they track most\n\n### What Appears on Hover\n- Chart data points show tooltip with exact value and date\n- Entry rows highlight with slightly darker background\n- Entry rows show \"Bearbeiten\" and \"Löschen\" action icons on far right when hovered\n- Quick add buttons show subtle lift shadow\n\n### Clickable/Interactive Areas\n- Clicking an entry row opens an inline expansion showing full details and edit form\n- Clicking a symptom type in the donut chart filters the entry list to that type\n- Chart is interactive: clicking a day shows entries from that day\n\n---\n\n## 6.

Implementation Checklist\n\nThe implementer should verify:\n- [ ] DM Sans font loaded from Google Fonts URL\n- [ ] All CSS variables copied exactly to src/index.css\n- [ ] Mobile layout matches Section 4 - hero dominates, stats are inline row\n- [ ] Desktop layout matches Section 5 - 60/40 column split\n- [ ] Hero wellness indicator shows semi-circle arc with score inside\n- [ ] Arc color reflects score (green=good, yellow=moderate, coral=poor)\n- [ ] Colors create the warm, calming wellness journal mood\n- [ ] Primary action button is fixed at bottom on mobile\n- [ ] Desktop has quick-add buttons prominently in sidebar\n- [ ] 7-day trend chart uses area chart with sage green fill\n- [ ] Entry list combines all three data types with type indicators\n- [ ] Empty states have friendly encouraging messages\n- [ ] Page load animation staggers elements as described\n- [ ] Arc animates from 0 to value on load\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}

Pay attention to:\n\n- **Section 3: Theme & Colors** → Font name, URL, and all color values\n- **Section 4: Mobile Layout** → Exact structure for phone screens\n- **Section 5: Desktop Layout** → Exact structure for computer screens\n- **Section 6: Components** → Hero KPI, secondary KPIs, charts, lists\n- **Section 7: Visual Details** → Border radius, shadows, animations\n- **Section 8: CSS Variables** → Copy these EXACTLY into src/index.css\n\nThe brief explains WHY decisions were made. This helps you understand intent, but your job is to implement what is written, not to interpret.\n\n### Step 2: Read Existing Code\n\n```bash\ncat src/types/*.ts\ncat src/services/livingAppsService.ts\n```\n\n### Step 3: Apply CSS Variables FIRST (CRITICAL!)\n\nBefore writing any React code, update the theme. Copy the CSS from **Section 8** of design_brief.md into `src/index.css`.\n\nshadcn/ui components use Tailwind CSS variables. If you don't update them, `<Card>`, `<Button>`, etc. will use **default colors** that don't match the design!\n\n```\ndesign_brief.md → src/index.css → Tailwind classes → shadcn components\n   (Section 8)      (CSS variables)   (bg-card, etc.)   (Card, Button)\n```\n\n#### Step 3a: Copy CSS Variables\n\nThe design_brief.md Section 8 contains ready-to-copy CSS. Copy it EXACTLY:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Copy ALL values from design_brief.md Section 8 */\n  --background: hsl(...);\n  --foreground: hsl(...);\n  /* etc. */\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3b: Light Mode (Always)\n\nThe design brief uses light mode. Make sure `index.html` does NOT have `class=\"dark\"`:\n\n```html\n<html lang=\"de\">  <!-- No \"dark\" class for light theme -->\n```\n\n### Step 4: Add Font\n\nCopy the font URL from **Section 3** of design_brief.md into `index.html`:\n\n```html\n<link href=\"[URL from Section 3]\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n### Step 5: Implement Dashboard.tsx\n\nNow implement the React component following the brief:\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Imports (always use 'import type' for types!)\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport type { AppType1, AppType2 } from '@/types/app';\nimport { LivingAppsService } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\n// 2. Follow Section 4 (Mobile) and Section 5 (Desktop) for layout\n// 3. Follow Section 6 for components (Hero, KPIs, Charts, Lists)\n// 4. Follow Section 7 for visual details (radius, shadows, animations)\n```\n\n### Step 6: Build and Deploy\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThen call `mcp__deploy_tools__deploy_to_github`\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Light mode defaults - used when NO .dark class */\n}\n\n.dark {\n  /* Dark mode - used when <html class=\"dark\"> */\n}\n```\n\n**Color Mapping Table:**\n\n| design_brief.md section | CSS Variable | Used by |\n|----------------------|--------------|---------|\n| `theme.colors.background` | `--background` | `bg-background`, body |\n| `theme.colors.foreground` | `--foreground` | `text-foreground`, body text |\n| `theme.colors.card` | `--card` | `<Card>` background |\n| `theme.colors.foreground` | `--card-foreground` | Text inside cards |\n| `theme.colors.primary` | `--primary` | `<Button>` default |\n| `theme.colors.accent` | `--accent` | Accent elements |\n| `theme.colors.muted` | `--muted` | Muted backgrounds |\n| `theme.colors.border` | `--border` | All borders |\n| `theme.colors.positive` | `--chart-2` | Success/positive in charts |\n| `theme.colors.negative` | `--destructive` | Error/negative |\n\n#### Step 4c: Example - Applying a Dark Theme\n\nIf design_brief.md says:\n```json\n{\n  \"theme\": {\n    \"mode\": \"dark\",\n    \"colors\": {\n      \"background\": \"hsl(215 28% 7%)\",\n      \"foreground\": \"hsl(215 10% 92%)\",\n      \"card\": \"hsl(215 25% 12%)\",\n      \"primary\": \"hsl(25 95% 53%)\",\n      \"accent\": \"hsl(173 80% 45%)\",\n      \"muted\": \"hsl(215 15% 20%)\",\n      \"border\": \"hsl(215 20% 18%)\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen update `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  --foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --card: hsl(215 25% 12%);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --popover: hsl(215 25% 12%);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --primary: hsl(25 95% 53%);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  \n  --accent: hsl(173 80% 45%);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  \n  --muted: hsl(215 15% 20%);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(215 10% 70%);\n  \n  --border: hsl(215 20% 18%);\n  --input: hsl(215 20% 18%);\n  --ring: hsl(173 80% 45%);\n}\n```\n\nAnd update `index.html`:\n```html\n<html lang=\"de\" class=\"dark\">\n```\n\n#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: CSS Color Format\n\nThe CSS variables **MUST use complete color functions**, not raw values!\n\n**❌ WRONG - Raw values break Tailwind:**\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: 220 25% 6%;        /* ❌ Just numbers - NOT a valid CSS color! */\n  --card: 220 20% 10%;             /* ❌ Browser ignores this, uses fallback! */\n}\n```\n\n**✅ CORRECT - Complete color functions:**\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: hsl(220 25% 6%);   /* ✓ Complete hsl() function */\n  --card: hsl(220 20% 10%);        /* ✓ Tailwind can use this */\n}\n```\n\n**Why raw values fail:**\n- Tailwind reads `var(--background)` directly for `bg-background`\n- If `--background` is `220 25% 6%` (just numbers), it's NOT a valid CSS color\n- Browser ignores invalid colors → falls back to white/transparent\n- Result: Light backgrounds with dark text = invisible!\n\n**Always copy the FULL hsl() function from design_brief.md Section 8, including the function name!**\n\n#### Why This Matters\n\nWithout this step:\n- `<Card>` uses default background (light/white)\n- Text colors (from design_brief) are for dark backgrounds\n- Result: **Light text on light cards = invisible!**\n\nWith this step:\n- All shadcn components automatically use your theme colors\n- Consistent look across all UI elements\n- No need to add inline styles everywhere\n\n### Step 5: Add Font from Spec\n\nIn `index.html`, add the font URL from design_brief.md Section 3:\n```html\n<link href=\"{font_url from spec}\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n### Step 6: Build and Test\n\n```bash\nnpm run build  # Must compile without errors\n```\n\n### Step 7: Deploy\n\n```\nCall mcp__deploy_tools__deploy_to_github\n```\n\n---\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### 1. Type Imports\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG\nimport { Workout } from '@/types/app';\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nimport type { Workout } from '@/types/app';\n```\n\n### 2. extractRecordId Always Has Null Check\n```typescript\nconst id = extractRecordId(record.fields.relation);\nif (!id) return;  // ✅ Always check!\n```\n\n### 3. Dates Without Seconds\n```typescript\n// For API: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM (no seconds!)\nconst dateForAPI = formData.date + 'T12:00';\n```\n\n### 4. Select Never Has Empty Value\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG\n<SelectItem value=\"\">None</SelectItem>\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\n<SelectItem value=\"none\">None</SelectItem>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\nBefore completing, verify EACH item against design_brief.md:\n\n### Theme Verification (CRITICAL!)\n- [ ] Font in `index.html` is EXACTLY from design_brief.md Section 3 (NOT Inter or Roboto!)\n- [ ] Font-family in CSS matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 3\n- [ ] `index.html` has NO \"dark\" class (light theme)\n- [ ] ALL CSS variables in `src/index.css` copied EXACTLY from design_brief.md Section 8\n- [ ] Colors are complete hsl() functions (not raw values)\n\n### Layout Verification\n- [ ] Mobile layout matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 4\n- [ ] Desktop layout matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 5\n- [ ] Hero element stands out as described\n- [ ] Section order matches the brief\n\n### Components Verification\n- [ ] Hero KPI matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6 \"Hero KPI\"\n- [ ] Secondary KPIs match EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6\n- [ ] Chart matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6 \"Chart\"\n- [ ] Primary action matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6\n\n### Visual Details Verification\n- [ ] Border radius matches design_brief.md Section 7\n- [ ] Shadow style matches design_brief.md Section 7\n- [ ] Animations match design_brief.md Section 7\n\n### Technical\n- [ ] `npm run build` passes\n- [ ] No console errors\n\n### ⚠️ COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION (CRITICAL!)\n\n**You MUST verify the dashboard is 100% complete before finishing:**\n\n- [ ] **Every app in app_metadata.json is used** - no data sources ignored\n- [ ] **Primary action works** (create new record via dialog/form)\n- [ ] **Data displays correctly** (all KPIs calculated, lists populated)\n- [ ] **All states handled:**\n  - [ ] Loading states for every data fetch\n  - [ ] Empty states with helpful guidance\n  - [ ] Error states with retry options\n- [ ] **Nothing is placeholder:**\n  - [ ] No \"TODO\" comments in code\n  - [ ] No \"Coming soon\" messages\n  - [ ] No hardcoded demo data\n\n**If ANY item above is unchecked, the dashboard is NOT complete. Fix it before deploying.**\n\n---\n\n## Definition of Done\n\nThe dashboard is complete when:\n\n1. ✅ **User experience excellent**: Intuitive, clear, professional\n2. ✅ **Primary action button works** (with Dialog/Modal)\n3. ✅ All KPIs/Stats calculated correctly\n4. ✅ Loading state works (Skeleton, not empty page)\n5. ✅ Error handling implemented (friendly messages)\n6. ✅ Empty state implemented (helpful placeholders)\n7. ✅ Responsive design (Mobile + Desktop)\n8. ✅ No TypeScript errors (`npm run build`)\n9. ✅ No console errors in browser\n10. ✅ Business logic correct\n11. ✅ Living Apps API rules followed (dates, applookup, response)\n12. ✅ **All features complete** - nothing skipped or left as TODO\n\n---\n\n## Drill-Down: When and How to Use It\n\nDrill-down is useful when there's **more information to show** than fits in the summary view. Don't add it everywhere - only where it adds value.\n\n### When to Use Drill-Down\n\n| Good Use Cases | Skip Drill-Down When... |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| List item → show full record details | The summary already shows everything |\n| Summary count → show the items being counted | It's a simple, self-explanatory number |\n| Record reference → view the related record | There's no additional detail to show |\n\n### Make It Obvious\n\nIf something is clickable, make it visually clear:\n- Hover effect (shadow, background change)\n- Cursor pointer\n- Underline or chevron icon for \"see more\"\n\n### Implementation Pattern: Clickable List Item\n\n```typescript\n// Use when list items have more details to show\n<div\n  className=\"p-3 rounded-lg hover:bg-muted cursor-pointer transition-colors\"\n  onClick={() => setSelectedRecord(record)}\n>\n  <div className=\"font-medium\">{record.name}</div>\n  <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">{record.summary}</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Don't force drill-down everywhere.** A simple KPI that shows \"5 workouts this week\" doesn't need a click handler if there's nothing more to show.\n\n---\n\n## UX Details - Don't Forget!\n\n### Loading States\n```typescript\nif (loading) {\n  return <LoadingState />;  // Use Skeleton, not spinner\n}\n```\n\n### Empty States\n```typescript\nif (data.length === 0) {\n  return (\n    <EmptyState \n      title=\"No data yet\"\n      description=\"Get started by adding your first item\"\n      action={<Button>Add First Item</Button>}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Error States\n```typescript\nif (error) {\n  return (\n    <Alert variant=\"destructive\">\n      <AlertCircle className=\"h-4 w-4\" />\n      <AlertTitle>Error</AlertTitle>\n      <AlertDescription>\n        {error.message}\n        <Button variant=\"outline\" onClick={retry}>Try Again</Button>\n      </AlertDescription>\n    </Alert>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Success Feedback\n```typescript\n// Use toast for success messages\nimport { toast } from '@/components/ui/use-toast';\n\ntoast({\n  title: \"Success!\",\n  description: \"Item saved successfully.\",\n});\n```\n\n### Hover States\n```typescript\n// Cards should have hover feedback\n<Card className=\"hover:shadow-md transition-shadow cursor-pointer\">\n```\n\n---\n\n# Living Apps API Reference\n\n## ⚠️ Critical API Rules\n\nThese rules are **non-negotiable**. Breaking them causes runtime errors.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Date Formats\n\nLiving Apps has strict date format requirements:\n\n| Field Type | Format | Example |\n|------------|--------|---------|\n| `date/datetimeminute` | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` | `2025-11-06T12:00` |\n| `date/date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `2025-11-06` |\n\n### ❌ WRONG\n```typescript\n// Seconds are NOT allowed for datetimeminute!\nconst date = '2025-11-06T12:00:00';  // ❌ Will fail\n```\n\n### ✅ CORRECT\n```typescript\n// For date/datetimeminute fields\nconst dateForAPI = formData.datum + 'T12:00';  // ✅ YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM\n\n// For date/date fields\nconst dateForAPI = formData.datum;  // ✅ YYYY-MM-DD\n\n// Display in <input type=\"date\">\nconst dateForInput = apiData.datum?.split('T')[0];  // Extract YYYY-MM-DD\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. applookup Fields\n\n`applookup/select` fields store **full URLs** to related records.\n\n### URL Format\n```\nhttps://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n```\n\n### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Always use extractRecordId()\n\n```typescript\n// ❌ NEVER do this manually\nconst parts = url.split('/');\nconst id = parts[parts.length - 1];  // ❌ Fragile!\n\n// ✅ ALWAYS use the helper function\nimport { extractRecordId } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\nconst recordId = extractRecordId(url);\nif (!recordId) return;  // ✅ Always null-check!\n```\n\n### extractRecordId() Implementation\n```typescript\nexport function extractRecordId(url: string | null | undefined): string | null {\n  if (!url) return null;\n  // Extracts last 24 hex characters (Living Apps Record IDs)\n  const match = url.match(/([a-f0-9]{24})$/i);\n  return match ? match[1] : null;\n}\n```\n\n### Creating applookup Values\n```typescript\nimport { createRecordUrl, APP_IDS } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\n// When creating/updating records with applookup fields\nconst data = {\n  kategorie: createRecordUrl(APP_IDS.KATEGORIEN, selectedKategorieId),\n};\n\n// createRecordUrl returns:\n// 'https://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}'\n```\n\n### applookup Can Be Null!\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG - Will crash if field is null\nworkoutLogs.forEach((log) => {\n  const id = extractRecordId(log.fields.uebung);\n  data[id] = log;  // ❌ Crashes if id is null\n});\n\n// ✅ CORRECT - Defensive programming\nworkoutLogs.forEach((log) => {\n  const id = extractRecordId(log.fields.uebung);\n  if (!id) return;  // ✅ Skip if null\n  if (!data[id]) data[id] = [];\n  data[id].push(log);\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. API Response Format\n\nLiving Apps returns **objects**, not arrays!\n\n### Response Structure\n```typescript\n// API returns:\n{\n  \"690abc123...\": {\n    \"createdat\": \"2025-11-06T10:00:00\",\n    \"updatedat\": null,\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"name\": \"Item 1\",\n      \"value\": 100\n    }\n  },\n  \"690def456...\": {\n    \"createdat\": \"2025-11-06T11:00:00\",\n    \"updatedat\": null,\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"name\": \"Item 2\",\n      \"value\": 200\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### ❌ WRONG Transformation\n```typescript\n// Loses record_id!\nconst items = Object.values(response);  // ❌ No record_id!\n```\n\n### ✅ CORRECT Transformation\n```typescript\n// Use Object.entries() to preserve record_id\nconst items = Object.entries(response).map(([record_id, record]) => ({\n  record_id,  // ← From the key\n  createdat: record.createdat,\n  updatedat: record.updatedat,\n  ...record.fields,\n}));\n```\n\n### Why record_id Matters\n- Required for React `key` prop\n- Required for update/delete operations\n- Required for applookup references\n\n---\n\n## 4. API Authentication\n\n```typescript\nconst headers = {\n  'X-API-Key': API_KEY,  // From environment\n  'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  'Accept': 'application/json',\n};\n```\n\n### Proxy vs Direct URL\n```typescript\n// For API calls (via proxy)\nconst API_BASE = '/api/rest';\n\n// For applookup values (direct)\nconst APPLOOKUP_BASE = 'https://my.living-apps.de/rest';\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. CRUD Operations\n\n### GET All Records\n```typescript\nGET /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records\n```\n\n### GET Single Record\n```typescript\nGET /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n```\n\n### CREATE Record\n```typescript\nPOST /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"New Item\",\n  \"value\": 100\n}\n```\n\n### UPDATE Record\n```typescript\nPATCH /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"value\": 150  // Only changed fields\n}\n```\n\n### DELETE Record\n```typescript\nDELETE /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n\n// Note: DELETE also returns JSON, always call response.json()\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Error Handling\n\n```typescript\nasync function callAPI(method: string, endpoint: string, data?: any) {\n  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}${endpoint}`, {\n    method,\n    headers: {\n      'X-API-Key': API_KEY,\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    },\n    body: data ? JSON.stringify(data) : undefined,\n  });\n\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    const errorText = await response.text();\n    throw new Error(`API Error (${response.status}): ${errorText}`);\n  }\n\n  return response.json();  // Always parse JSON, even for DELETE\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Metadata Structure\n\n`app_metadata.json` contains the **complete, real metadata from Living Apps REST API**.\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n- `controls` is an **OBJECT** (not array!)\n- Each control has `identifier`, `label`, `type`, `subtype`, `fulltype`\n- `lookup/select` has `lookup_data` with all options\n- `applookup/select` has `lookup_app` URL to the linked app\n\n```typescript\n{\n  \"appgroup_id\": \"...\",\n  \"appgroup_name\": \"My App Group\",\n  \"apps\": {\n    \"app_identifier\": {\n      \"app_id\": \"...\",\n      \"name\": \"App Display Name\",\n      \"controls\": {\n        \"control_identifier\": {\n          \"identifier\": \"field_name\",      // Use this as field key\n          \"label\": \"Field Label\",          // Use this for UI display\n          \"type\": \"string\",                // Base type\n          \"subtype\": null,                 // or \"select\", \"textarea\", etc.\n          \"fulltype\": \"string/text\",       // Combined: type/subtype\n          \"lookup_data\": [                 // For lookup/select fields\n            { \"key\": \"option1\", \"value\": \"Option 1\" },\n            { \"key\": \"option2\", \"value\": \"Option 2\" }\n          ],\n          \"lookup_app\": \"https://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}\"  // For applookup\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Common Field Types\n| fulltype | TypeScript | Notes |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| `string/text` | `string` | Plain text |\n| `string/textarea` | `string` | Multiline text |\n| `number/number` | `number` | Numeric |\n| `bool/bool` | `boolean` | True/false |\n| `date/date` | `string` | YYYY-MM-DD |\n| `date/datetimeminute` | `string` | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM (NO seconds!) |\n| `lookup/select` | `string` | From predefined list (lookup_data) |\n| `applookup/select` | `string \\| null` | URL to another app's record |\n\n### Using Metadata for UI\n```typescript\n// Use field labels for UI\nconst fieldLabel = metadata.apps.myapp.controls.myfield.label;\n\n// Use lookup_data for Select options\nconst options = metadata.apps.myapp.controls.status.lookup_data;\n// → [{ key: \"active\", value: \"Active\" }, { key: \"done\", value: \"Done\" }]\n```\n\n---\n\n# Code Patterns Reference\n\n## Available Libraries\n\n### shadcn/ui Components\n\nAll shadcn components are pre-installed in `/src/components/ui/`\n\n```typescript\nimport { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '@/components/ui/card';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport { Badge } from '@/components/ui/badge';\nimport { Input } from '@/components/ui/input';\nimport { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';\nimport { Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogTrigger } from '@/components/ui/dialog';\nimport { Table, TableBody, TableCell, TableHead, TableHeader, TableRow } from '@/components/ui/table';\nimport { Skeleton } from '@/components/ui/skeleton';\nimport { Alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle } from '@/components/ui/alert';\n// etc.\n```\n\n**To find specific components or examples, use shadcn MCP Tools:**\n```\nmcp_shadcn_search_items_in_registries(registries: ['@shadcn'], query: 'chart')\nmcp_shadcn_view_items_in_registries(items: ['@shadcn/card'])\nmcp_shadcn_get_item_examples_from_registries(registries: ['@shadcn'], query: 'card-demo')\n```\n\n### recharts (Charts)\n\nPre-installed!

November 2025\"\n\n// Relative time\nformatDistance(parseISO(record.createdat), new Date(), { \n  addSuffix: true, \n  locale: de \n});\n// → \"vor 3 Tagen\"\n\n// For input type=\"date\"\nconst inputValue = record.datum?.split('T')[0] || '';\n// → \"2025-11-06\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## TypeScript Patterns\n\n### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Type-Only Imports\n\nTypeScript's `verbatimModuleSyntax` requires explicit type imports:\n\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG - TypeScript error\nimport { Workout, Ernaehrung } from '@/types/app';\n\n// ✅ CORRECT - Option 1 (preferred)\nimport type { Workout, Ernaehrung } from '@/types/app';\n\n// ✅ CORRECT - Option 2\nimport { type Workout, type Ernaehrung } from '@/types/app';\n```\n\n---\n\n## Data Fetching Pattern\n\n```typescript\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport type { Workout } from '@/types/app';\nimport { LivingAppsService } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\nfunction Dashboard() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState<Workout[]>([]);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    async function fetchData() {\n      try {\n        setLoading(true);\n        const result = await LivingAppsService.getWorkouts();\n        setData(result);\n      } catch (err) {\n        setError(err instanceof Error ?
