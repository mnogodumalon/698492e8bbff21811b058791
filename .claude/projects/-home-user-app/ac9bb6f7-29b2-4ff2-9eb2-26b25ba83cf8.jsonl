Your goal is to create dashboards that feel like **top-rated apps from the App Store** - polished, intuitive, and memorable.\n\nYour output is `design_brief.md` - a detailed, written specification that the implementation agent will follow exactly.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Why Markdown, Not JSON\n\nYou write a **design brief** in Markdown because:\n\n1. **Explains WHY** - You can explain your reasoning, which helps the implementer understand intent\n2. **Reads as instructions** - The implementer treats it as guidance, not just data\n3. **Allows nuance** - You can describe visual details that don't fit in JSON fields\n4. **Prevents misinterpretation** - Explicit descriptions leave no room for \"creative interpretation\"\n\n---\n\n## Design Standard: App Store Quality\n\nYour designs must meet the quality bar of **the best apps in the App Store**:\n\n- **Layouts that feel native** to each device (not just \"responsive\")\n- **Information architecture** that makes sense instantly\n- **Touch targets and interactions** designed for each platform\n- **Visual hierarchy** that guides the eye naturally\n- **Distinctive details** that make the app memorable\n\nAsk yourself: **\"Would Apple feature this in the App Store?\"** If no, redesign.\n\n---\n\n## Theme: Light, Minimal, BUT Distinctive\n\n**Always use light mode.** But minimal does NOT mean generic or boring.\n\n### The Balance\n\n- **Minimalist** - Every element has a purpose, no clutter\n- **Modern** - Clean lines, subtle shadows, refined typography\n- **Neutral** - Calm, professional base\n- **BUT Distinctive** - One or two memorable details that make it special\n\n### What Makes a Minimal Design Distinctive?\n\nGreat minimal apps have subtle touches that create personality:\n\n1. **A refined color accent** - Not generic blue, but a carefully chosen tone\n2. **Thoughtful typography** - Font weight, size, and spacing that feels considered\n3. **Subtle texture or depth** - Light gradients, gentle shadows, or background patterns\n4. **Micro-details** - Icon style, border radius, spacing rhythm\n5. **Intentional white space** - Not just \"empty\" but compositionally balanced\n\n### Color Philosophy for Light Theme\n\nStart with a warm or cool base, not pure white:\n- **Warm base**: Off-white with slight cream/yellow undertone\n- **Cool base**: Off-white with slight blue/gray undertone\n\nThen add ONE carefully chosen accent color:\n- Not generic blue (#007bff) or green (#28a745)\n- Pick a specific, refined tone that fits the app's domain\n- Use sparingly - accent highlights important elements\n\n### Typography Philosophy\n\n**FORBIDDEN FONTS:** Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Arial, Helvetica, system-ui\n\nThese fonts are so common they signal \"no design thought went into this.\"\n\n**Choose fonts that add character while remaining readable:**\n\n| App Character | Recommended Fonts |\n|--------------|-------------------|\n| Data/Analytics | Space Grotesk, IBM Plex Sans, Geist |\n| Fitness/Health | Outfit, Nunito Sans, DM Sans |\n| Finance | Source Serif 4, Newsreader, IBM Plex Serif |\n| Creative | Syne, Bricolage Grotesque, Cabinet Grotesk |\n| Professional | Source Sans 3, Plus Jakarta Sans, Manrope |\n\n**Typography creates hierarchy through:**\n- Extreme weight differences (300 vs 700, not 400 vs 500)\n- Size jumps (24px vs 14px, not 16px vs 14px)\n- Careful letter-spacing adjustments\n\n---\n\n## Layout Design (MOST IMPORTANT!)\n\nLayout is the foundation of good UX. Spend the most time here.\n\n**⚠️ The #1 reason dashboards look like \"AI slop\" is a boring, symmetrical grid layout.** Real designers create visual tension and flow. Your layout must feel hand-crafted by a senior product designer for THIS specific app.\n\n### Think Like a Product Designer\n\nBefore drawing anything, answer:\n\n1. **What is the ONE thing users must see first?**\n   - This becomes your hero element - the visual anchor\n   - Everything else supports this\n\n2. **What actions do users take most often?**\n   - The #1 action becomes your Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n   - Maximum 1-2 taps/clicks to reach\n   - Position for thumb reach on mobile\n   - This dashboard is interactive, NOT read-only!\n\n3. **What is the user's mental model?**\n   - How do they naturally think about this data?\n   - Your layout should mirror their thinking\n\n4. **What is the user's workflow?**\n   - What sequence of actions do they take?\n   - How can the layout support this flow?\n\n---\n\n### Creating Visual Interest\n\nThe goal is a layout that feels **intentionally designed for THIS app**, not a generic template.\n\n**The core principle:** Every layout needs at least ONE element that creates visual interest - something that breaks the monotony of identical boxes. This could be:\n\n- **Size variation** - One element noticeably larger than others (the hero)\n- **Weight variation** - Mix of bold and subtle elements\n- **Spacing variation** - Tighter grouping within sections, more space between\n- **Format variation** - Mix of cards, inline text, badges (not everything in cards)\n- **Typography variation** - Different sizes that create clear hierarchy\n\n### Symmetric vs Asymmetric Layouts\n\n**Both can work well.** Choose based on what suits the app:\n\n**Symmetric layouts work when:**\n- The app has 2-4 equally important metrics\n- The data is naturally balanced (e.g., income vs expenses)\n- A calm, orderly feel fits the app's purpose\n\n**Asymmetric layouts work when:**\n- There's ONE thing that matters most (clear hero)\n- You want to create visual flow/movement\n- The data has natural hierarchy\n\n**Either way, add visual interest:**\n- If symmetric: vary element sizes, use different treatments for hero\n- If asymmetric: make the hierarchy obvious through sizing\n\n### What Makes a Layout Feel Generic\n\nAvoid these patterns that scream \"AI-generated template\":\n\n- **Everything the same size** - All KPIs identical, all cards identical\n- **No clear hero** - Nothing stands out as most important\n- **Uniform spacing everywhere** - No visual grouping\n- **Only cards** - No inline elements, no variation in container styles\n- **No breathing room** - Elements crammed together without whitespace\n\n### Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\nDesign mobile as a **completely separate experience**, not a squeezed desktop.\n\n**Mobile Principles:**\n- **Vertical flow** - One column, top to bottom\n- **Thumb-friendly** - Important actions in bottom half\n- **Focused** - Show less, but show it well\n- **Progressive** - Reveal details on interaction\n- **Hero stands out** - Make the most important element visually dominant\n\n**Mobile Questions:**\n- What needs to be LARGER for comfortable touch?\n- Where should the primary action live? (Thumb zone)\n- How does the hero stand out from other content?\n- How should content be reorganized to fit the vertical flow?\n\nNote: Only hide elements on mobile if they're truly impossible to use on a phone. Users expect the same functionality on all devices.\n\n**Mobile Layout Ideas:**\n- Hero KPI takes entire top fold, everything else scrolls below\n- Compact horizontal scroll for secondary KPIs\n- Inline summary row (not cards) for quick stats\n- Bottom sheet for additional details\n\n### Desktop Layout\n\nDesign desktop to take full advantage of horizontal space.\n\n**Desktop Principles:**\n- **Use the width** - Multi-column layouts where appropriate\n- **Horizontal density** - Side-by-side information\n- **Hover reveals** - Secondary info on hover\n- **Peripheral vision** - Context without overwhelming\n- **Keyboard awareness** - Power user shortcuts\n\n**Desktop Questions:**\n- How does the extra width add value? (Not just stretching)\n- Which side gets the hero element?\n- What information benefits from side-by-side comparison?\n- What hover states add useful information?\n- Where can you break the grid intentionally?\n\n**Desktop Layout Ideas:**\n- Wide left column (hero + chart) + narrow right column (recent activity)\n- Full-width hero banner, then 3 unequal columns below\n- Sidebar with key stats, main area with detailed views\n- Sticky summary header while scrolling through details\n\n---\n\n## Information Hierarchy\n\nUsers scan, they don't read. Design for scanning.\n\n**Hierarchy Levels:**\n1. **Primary** - ONE thing that matters most (largest, boldest)\n2. **Secondary** - Supporting information (medium)\n3. **Tertiary** - Details, metadata (smallest, muted)\n\n**Hierarchy Tools:**\n- Size (larger = more important)\n- Weight (bolder = more important)\n- Color (accent = important/interactive)\n- Position (top/left = seen first)\n- Space (more whitespace = more important)\n\n---\n\n## Your Output: design_brief.md\n\nWrite a detailed design brief in Markdown.

What proportions?\n- Where does the eye go first, second, third?\n- What creates visual interest in this layout?]\n\n### Section Layout\n[Describe what goes where:\n- Top area: [what content]\n- Main content area: [what content]\n- Supporting areas: [what content]\nInclude proportions if using multi-column layout.]\n\n### What Appears on Hover\n[What extra information is revealed when hovering over elements?]\n\n### Clickable/Interactive Areas (if applicable)\n[If any elements should open detail views when clicked, note them here.\nOnly add where it provides additional useful information.]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Components\n\n### Hero KPI\nThe MOST important metric that users see first.\n\n- **Title:** [Name]\n- **Data source:** [Which app to query]\n- **Calculation:** [How to calculate: sum, count, latest, etc.]\n- **Display:** [How it looks - large number? With icon? Progress ring?]\n- **Context shown:** [What comparison? Goal progress? Trend?]\n- **Why this is the hero:** [Explain why this matters most to users]\n\n### Secondary KPIs\n[For each secondary KPI:]\n\n**[KPI Name]**\n- Source: [App]\n- Calculation: [How]\n- Format: [number/currency/percent]\n- Display: [Card? Inline? Size?]\n\n### Chart (if applicable)\n- **Type:** [line/bar/area - and WHY this type]\n- **Title:** [Chart title]\n- **What question it answers:** [Why does the user need this chart?]\n- **Data source:** [App]\n- **X-axis:** [Field, label]\n- **Y-axis:** [Field, label]\n- **Mobile simplification:** [How is it simplified for small screens?]\n\n### Lists/Tables (if applicable)\n[For each list:]\n\n**[Section Name]**\n- Purpose: [Why users need this]\n- Source: [App]\n- Fields shown: [Which fields]\n- Mobile style: [cards/simple list]\n- Desktop style: [table/cards]\n- Sort: [By what field]\n- Limit: [How many items]\n\n### Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n\n**⚠️ Every dashboard MUST have a primary action.** This is NOT a read-only view!\n\nUsers need to DO things from the dashboard, not just look at data. The most common action should be one tap/click away.\n\nThink about what action users perform most often:\n- Adding a new record (workout, meal, expense, etc.)\n- Logging something (weight, progress, status)\n- Starting a process (timer, session, etc.)\n\n**This section is REQUIRED - do not skip it or write \"None\"!**\n\n- **Label:** [Action-oriented text, e.g. \"Workout starten\", \"Mahlzeit hinzufügen\"]\n- **Action:** [add_record | navigate - specify which]\n- **Target app:** [Which Living Apps app receives the data]\n- **What data:** [What fields will the form contain]\n- **Mobile position:** [bottom_fixed (recommended) | header | fab]\n- **Desktop position:** [header | sidebar | inline]\n- **Why this action:** [Why is this the most important thing users do?]\n\nThe implementation skill knows how to create forms that send data to Living Apps API.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Visual Details\n\n### Border Radius\n[sharp (4px) / rounded (8px) / pill (16px+)]\n\n### Shadows\n[none / subtle / elevated - describe the shadow style]\n\n### Spacing\n[compact / normal / spacious - how much breathing room?]\n\n### Animations\n- **Page load:** [none / fade / stagger]\n- **Hover effects:** [What happens on hover?]\n- **Tap feedback:** [What happens on tap?]\n\n---\n\n## 8. CSS Variables (Copy Exactly!)\n\nThe implementer MUST copy these values exactly into `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: hsl(...);\n  --foreground: hsl(...);\n  --card: hsl(...);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --popover: hsl(...);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --primary: hsl(...);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --secondary: hsl(...);\n  --secondary-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --muted: hsl(...);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --accent: hsl(...);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --destructive: hsl(...);\n  --border: hsl(...);\n  --input: hsl(...);\n  --ring: hsl(...);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. Implementation Checklist\n\nThe implementer should verify:\n- [ ] Font loaded from URL above\n- [ ] All CSS variables copied exactly\n- [ ] Mobile layout matches Section 4\n- [ ] Desktop layout matches Section 5\n- [ ] Hero element is prominent as described\n- [ ] Colors create the mood described in Section 2\n```\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ How Colors Are Applied (Critical!)\n\nYour colors are mapped to CSS variables. The implementation agent uses them directly.\n\n**Color Mapping:**\n\n| Your design_brief color | CSS Variable |\n|-------------------------|--------------|\n| `background` | `--background` |\n| `foreground` | `--foreground` |\n| `card` | `--card` |\n| `card_foreground` | `--card-foreground` |\n| `primary` | `--primary` |\n| `primary_foreground` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| `accent` | `--accent` |\n| `muted` | `--muted` |\n| `muted_foreground` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| `border` | `--border` |\n| `negative` | `--destructive` |\n\n**Light Theme Contrast Rules:**\n- `foreground` must be dark (readable on light backgrounds)\n- `card` can be white or slightly off-white\n- `card_foreground` must be dark\n- `primary` needs sufficient contrast for buttons\n\n**All colors MUST be complete hsl() functions:**\n```\n\"background\": \"hsl(40 20% 98%)\"   // ✅ Complete function\n\"background\": \"40 20% 98%\"        // ❌ Will break!\n```\n\n---\n\n## Quality Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing design_brief.md:\n\n### Distinctiveness\n- [ ] Would a designer recognize this as intentionally designed (not default)?\n- [ ] Is there at least ONE memorable visual detail?\n- [ ] Is the font choice appropriate and NOT from forbidden list?\n- [ ] Does the color accent feel considered, not generic?\n\n### Layout & UX (CRITICAL FOR AVOIDING AI SLOP!)\n- [ ] Is there ONE clear hero element that stands out?\n- [ ] Is there visual interest? (size variation, typography hierarchy, spacing variation)\n- [ ] NOT everything the same size - some variation exists\n- [ ] Is mobile designed FOR mobile (not just smaller)?\n- [ ] Does desktop use horizontal space meaningfully?\n- [ ] Would this get featured in the App Store?\n\n### Interactivity\n- [ ] Is the primary action clearly defined?\n- [ ] Are clickable elements marked where drill-down adds value?\n\n### Information\n- [ ] Is the visual hierarchy clear?\n- [ ] Are all relevant KPIs included?\n\n### Clarity\n- [ ] Is every section detailed enough that someone else could implement it?\n- [ ] Are there WHY explanations for major decisions?\n- [ ] Are the CSS variables complete and ready to copy?\n- [ ] Is the Layout Strategy section filled out with specific proportions?\n\n### Technical\n- [ ] Are all colors complete hsl() functions?\n- [ ] Is contrast sufficient for readability?\n- [ ] Are all required colors defined?\n\n---\n\n## Remember\n\n1. **Write for the implementer** - They will follow your words exactly\n2. **Explain WHY** - Context helps them understand intent\n3. **Be specific** - \"Large number\" is vague, \"48px bold\" is specific\n4. **Minimal ≠ Generic** - Minimal can be distinctive\n5. **Layout is everything** - 80% of design time on layout\n6. **Visual interest is required** - Vary sizes, not everything identical\n7. **Mobile ≠ Small Desktop** - Separate experiences\n8. **One memorable detail** - What makes this special?\n9. **App Store quality** - Would Apple feature this?\n","numLines":613,"startLine":1,"totalLines":613}}}

App Analysis\n\n### What This App Does\nThis is a personal health and nutrition diary that helps users track three interconnected aspects of their daily wellness: what they eat (Essgewohnheiten), symptoms they experience (Symptomerfassung), and medications they take (Medikamenteneinnahme). The app enables users to identify correlations between diet, symptoms, and medication effectiveness over time. The \"Tägliche Erfassung\" app serves as a combined daily entry point.\n\n### Who Uses This\nHealth-conscious individuals tracking their wellness journey - likely someone managing a chronic condition, food sensitivities, or working with a healthcare provider to understand symptom patterns. They want quick daily logging and the ability to spot trends.\n\n### The ONE Thing Users Care About Most\n**\"How am I feeling today compared to recent days?\"** - Users want an immediate snapshot of their current symptom status and whether things are improving or worsening. The symptom trend is the hero.\n\n### Primary Actions (IMPORTANT!)\n1. **Quick daily entry** → Primary Action Button (using Tägliche Erfassung)\n2. Log a specific symptom\n3. Record medication intake\n4. Add a meal entry\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Makes This Design Distinctive\n\n### Visual Identity\nA calming, wellness-focused aesthetic with a soft sage green accent on a warm off-white canvas. The design feels like a premium wellness app - serene but not clinical, personal but not juvenile. The green evokes natural health and balance without being cliché. Generous whitespace creates breathing room that reflects the app's purpose of mindful self-tracking.\n\n### Layout Strategy\n- **Hero element:** A large symptom wellness score/indicator that dominates the top of the viewport. This uses size (large typography), prominent positioning (top center), and ample whitespace to create clear visual hierarchy.\n- **Asymmetric layout on desktop:** Wide left column (70%) for primary content (hero + symptom chart), narrow right sidebar (30%) for quick actions and recent activity.\n- **Size variation:** The hero wellness indicator is dramatically larger than secondary KPIs (48px vs 14px supporting text). Secondary stats are compact inline badges, not cards.\n- **Typography creates rhythm:** Bold 600-weight numbers with light 300-weight labels creates visual interest without clutter.\n\n### Unique Element\nThe hero \"Wellness Score\" is displayed as a large number with a subtle colored background pill that shifts color based on the average symptom rating (green for good, amber for moderate, soft red for concerning). This creates an instant emotional read without requiring users to interpret numbers.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Theme & Colors\n\n### Font\n- **Family:** Plus Jakarta Sans\n- **URL:** `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Plus+Jakarta+Sans:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap`\n- **Why this font:** Plus Jakarta Sans has a warm, approachable character with excellent readability. It's professional enough for health data but friendly enough for daily personal use. The font has distinctive letter shapes that prevent it from feeling generic.\n\n### Color Palette\nAll colors as complete hsl() functions:\n\n| Purpose | Color | CSS Variable |\n|---------|-------|--------------|\n| Page background | `hsl(45 30% 97%)` | `--background` |\n| Main text | `hsl(200 15% 20%)` | `--foreground` |\n| Card background | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--card` |\n| Card text | `hsl(200 15% 20%)` | `--card-foreground` |\n| Borders | `hsl(45 15% 88%)` | `--border` |\n| Primary action | `hsl(152 35% 45%)` | `--primary` |\n| Text on primary | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| Accent highlight | `hsl(152 25% 94%)` | `--accent` |\n| Muted background | `hsl(45 20% 94%)` | `--muted` |\n| Muted text | `hsl(200 10% 50%)` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| Success/positive | `hsl(152 45% 42%)` | (component use) |\n| Warning/moderate | `hsl(38 70% 55%)` | (component use) |\n| Error/negative | `hsl(0 55% 55%)` | `--destructive` |\n\n### Why These Colors\nThe warm off-white background (slight cream undertone) creates a soft, inviting canvas that feels personal rather than clinical. The sage green primary evokes natural health and wellness without being the typical \"medical blue.\" The muted text color has a slight blue-gray that creates calm contrast. The warning amber and soft red are intentionally muted to avoid alarming users.\n\n### Background Treatment\nThe page background uses a warm off-white (`hsl(45 30% 97%)`) that gives the interface warmth. Cards are pure white to create subtle depth without heavy shadows. This creates a layered, calm aesthetic.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\nDesign mobile as a COMPLETELY SEPARATE experience, not squeezed desktop.\n\n### Layout Approach\nThe hero wellness indicator dominates the first viewport, creating an immediate emotional connection. Secondary stats are presented as a compact horizontal row of badges (not cards) to preserve vertical space. Visual interest comes from the dramatic size difference between the hero (large) and supporting elements (compact).\n\n### What Users See (Top to Bottom)\n\n**Header:**\n- App title \"Mein Gesundheitstagebuch\" left-aligned, 18px semi-bold\n- No navigation icons in header (action is fixed at bottom)\n\n**Hero Section (The FIRST thing users see):**\n- Takes approximately 35% of viewport height\n- Large wellness indicator in center: the average symptom score displayed as a number (64px bold) with a label \"Aktuelles Befinden\" (14px light) above it\n- Below the number: a subtle pill badge showing trend (\"Besser als gestern\" / \"Wie gestern\" / \"Schlechter als gestern\") with appropriate icon\n- The entire hero section has a subtle rounded background color that reflects the score:\n  - Score 1-3: light green tint (`hsl(152 40% 94%)`)\n  - Score 4-6: light amber tint (`hsl(38 50% 94%)`)\n  - Score 7-10: light coral tint (`hsl(0 40% 95%)`)\n- Why hero: This immediately answers \"How am I doing?\" which is the primary user question\n\n**Section 2: Heute auf einen Blick (Today's Summary)**\n- Horizontal row of 3 compact stat badges (not cards):\n  - Mahlzeiten: count icon + number\n  - Medikamente: pill icon + number\n  - Symptome: heart icon + number logged today\n- Each badge: subtle muted background, 12px text, icon 16px\n- Total row height: ~48px with padding\n\n**Section 3: Symptom-Verlauf (7-Tage)**\n- Section title \"Letzte 7 Tage\" with muted text, 14px\n- Simple area chart showing daily average symptom scores\n- Chart height: ~160px\n- Minimal styling: single sage green line/area, light grid, date labels on x-axis\n- Touch: tap on a point shows tooltip with that day's details\n\n**Section 4: Letzte Einträge**\n- Section title \"Letzte Einträge\"\n- Vertical list of last 5 entries across all apps\n- Each entry: icon (meal/pill/symptom), description truncated, time \"vor 2 Std\"\n- Simple dividers between entries, no cards\n- If tapped: expands to show full details inline\n\n**Bottom Navigation / Action:**\n- Fixed bottom bar with prominent primary action button\n- Button: \"Eintrag hinzufügen\" with + icon\n- Full-width minus padding, 52px height\n- Sage green background, white text, rounded-lg corners\n\n### Mobile-Specific Adaptations\n- Chart simplified: only 7 data points, no hover states\n- Recent entries list limited to 5 items\n- All cards replaced with lightweight divider-separated rows\n- Hero dominates first fold, everything else requires scroll\n\n### Touch Targets\n- Primary action button: 52px height minimum\n- List items: 48px minimum tap height\n- Chart data points: 44px touch target around each point\n\n### Interactive Elements\n- Chart points: tap to reveal daily detail tooltip\n- Recent entry items: tap to expand and show full entry details\n- Wellness pill badge: tap to see breakdown of symptoms contributing to score\n\n---\n\n## 5. Desktop Layout\n\n### Overall Structure\nTwo-column asymmetric layout:\n- **Left column (70%):** Hero wellness indicator + symptom trend chart + recent entries\n- **Right sidebar (30%):** Quick action buttons + today's summary stats + medication reminder\n\nEye flow: Hero (top-left) → Chart (below hero) → Sidebar quick actions (right) → Recent entries (scroll)\n\nVisual interest comes from the asymmetric split and the hero's dominant sizing within the left column.\n\n### Section Layout\n\n**Top Area (Hero Row):**\n- Left: Large wellness indicator (same as mobile but larger - 72px number)\n- Trend badge below the number\n- Total hero section: ~200px height with generous whitespace\n\n**Main Content Area (Left Column, Below Hero):**\n- Symptom trend chart: full width of left column, 280px height\n- Title \"Symptom-Verlauf\" above chart\n- Below chart: \"Letzte Einträge\" section as a compact table-like list\n\n**Right Sidebar:**\n- Sticky when scrolling\n- Quick Action Card: \"Schnelleintrag\" with 3 icon buttons stacked:\n  - Mahlzeit erfassen\n  - Symptom erfassen\n  - Medikament erfassen\n- Below: Today's Stats card showing same 3 metrics as mobile but vertical\n- Below: If any medications due, show reminder card\n\n### What Appears on Hover\n- Chart line points: detailed tooltip with exact values and notes\n- Recent entry rows: subtle background highlight, shows \"Details anzeigen\" text\n- Quick action buttons: slight scale up (1.02) and shadow increase\n\n### Clickable/Interactive Areas\n- Each recent entry row: click opens a slide-over panel with full details\n- Chart: click on data point shows that day's full log\n- Wellness score: click shows breakdown modal of contributing symptoms\n\n---\n\n## 6. Components\n\n### Hero KPI\nThe MOST important metric that users see first.\n\n- **Title:** Aktuelles Befinden\n- **Data source:** Symptomerfassung (symptom tracking app)\n- **Calculation:** Average of `bewertung_symptom` values from today's entries. Score is inverted for display: 1 (Sehr gut) = best, 10 (Sehr schlecht) = worst. Calculate average, then display. If no entries today, show yesterday's average with \"Gestern:\" prefix.\n- **Display:** Large centered number (64px mobile, 72px desktop, font-weight 700). Colored background pill behind the entire hero section. Subtle trend indicator below.\n- **Context shown:** Comparison text: \"Besser als gestern\" (if today avg < yesterday avg), \"Wie gestern\" (same), \"Schlechter als gestern\" (if worse). Show with small arrow icon.\n- **Why this is the hero:** Users open the app to answer \"How am I feeling?\" - this answers it instantly with both a number and emotional color coding.\n\n### Secondary KPIs\n\n**Mahlzeiten heute**\n- Source: Essgewohnheiten (filtered to today)\n- Calculation: Count of records where `zeitpunkt_mahlzeit` is today\n- Format: number\n- Display: Compact inline badge with utensil icon, muted background\n\n**Medikamente heute**\n- Source: Medikamenteneinnahme (filtered to today)\n- Calculation: Count of records where `zeitpunkt_einnahme` is today\n- Format: number\n- Display: Compact inline badge with pill icon, muted background\n\n**Symptome erfasst**\n- Source: Symptomerfassung (filtered to today)\n- Calculation: Count of records where `zeitpunkt_symptom` is today\n- Format: number\n- Display: Compact inline badge with activity/pulse icon, muted background\n\n### Chart\n\n- **Type:** Area chart (soft filled area under line) - chosen because it shows trend progression smoothly and the filled area creates visual weight that emphasizes the wellness journey over time. Line-only would feel too clinical.\n- **Title:** Symptom-Verlauf (letzte 7 Tage)\n- **What question it answers:** \"Is my condition improving, stable, or worsening over the past week?\"\n- **Data source:** Symptomerfassung\n- **X-axis:** Date (last 7 days), formatted as weekday abbreviation (Mo, Di, Mi, Do, Fr, Sa, So)\n- **Y-axis:** Average symptom score (1-10 scale, but inverted visually: 1 at top = good, 10 at bottom = bad). Label: \"Befinden\"\n- **Mobile simplification:** Same chart, but remove y-axis labels, only show gridlines. Touch points for tooltips.\n- **Colors:** Sage green fill with 20% opacity, solid sage green line\n\n### Lists/Tables\n\n**Letzte Einträge (Recent Entries)**\n- Purpose: Quick review of what was logged recently, helps users remember if they logged something\n- Source: Combined from all apps (Essgewohnheiten, Medikamenteneinnahme, Symptomerfassung, TaeglicheErfassung)\n- Fields shown:\n  - Icon (varies by type: utensils for meals, pill for meds, activity for symptoms, calendar for daily)\n  - Primary text: meal description, medication name, or symptom type\n  - Secondary text: time ago (vor X Min/Std/Tagen)\n  - For symptoms: small colored dot indicating severity\n- Mobile style: Simple list with subtle dividers, no cards\n- Desktop style: Compact table-like rows with hover state\n- Sort: By datetime descending (most recent first)\n- Limit: 5 on mobile, 10 on desktop\n\n### Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n\n- **Label:** \"Eintrag hinzufügen\" (with + icon)\n- **Action:** Opens a modal/sheet with quick entry form for Tägliche Erfassung\n- **Target app:** Tägliche Erfassung (69858612b7a952d0ddc01987)\n- **What data:** The form includes:\n  - Datum und Uhrzeit (auto-filled to now)\n  - Symptom quick-select (dropdown: Räuspern, Lymphschwellung, Energie, Stimmung)\n  - Bewertung (1-5 scale radio: Sehr gut → Sehr schlecht)\n  - Optional: Mahlzeit description (textarea)\n  - Optional: Medikament (dropdown from list)\n  - Submit button: \"Speichern\"\n- **Mobile position:** bottom_fixed - full-width button in a fixed bottom bar\n- **Desktop position:** Prominent in right sidebar, top of sidebar\n- **Why this action:** Daily tracking is the core workflow. Users need to log multiple data points (symptom + meal + meds) quickly. The Tägliche Erfassung app combines all three, making it the most efficient single action.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Visual Details\n\n### Border Radius\n- Cards: 12px (rounded-xl)\n- Buttons: 10px (rounded-lg)\n- Badges/pills: 9999px (full pill shape)\n- Input fields: 8px (rounded-md)\n\n### Shadows\n- Cards: Subtle shadow `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.05), 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.03)`\n- Elevated elements (modals, dropdowns): `0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`\n- Buttons on hover: `0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`\n\n### Spacing\n- Spacious - generous padding throughout\n- Card internal padding: 20px (mobile), 24px (desktop)\n- Section gaps: 24px (mobile), 32px (desktop)\n- Element gaps within sections: 12px\n\n### Animations\n- **Page load:** Subtle stagger fade-in. Hero fades in first (0ms), then stats (100ms), then chart (200ms), then list (300ms). Each fade takes 300ms with ease-out.\n- **Hover effects:** Cards lift slightly (translateY -2px) with shadow increase. Buttons scale to 1.02. Transitions: 150ms ease.\n- **Tap feedback:** Brief scale down to 0.98 then back. 100ms duration.\n\n---\n\n## 8. CSS Variables (Copy Exactly!)\n\nThe implementer MUST copy these values exactly into `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: hsl(45 30% 97%);\n  --foreground: hsl(200 15% 20%);\n  --card: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(200 15% 20%);\n  --popover: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(200 15% 20%);\n  --primary: hsl(152 35% 45%);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --secondary: hsl(45 20% 94%);\n  --secondary-foreground: hsl(200 15% 25%);\n  --muted: hsl(45 20% 94%);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(200 10% 50%);\n  --accent: hsl(152 25% 94%);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(152 35% 30%);\n  --destructive: hsl(0 55% 55%);\n  --border: hsl(45 15% 88%);\n  --input: hsl(45 15% 88%);\n  --ring: hsl(152 35% 45%);\n  --radius: 0.75rem;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9.

App Analysis\n\n### What This App Does\nThis is a personal health and nutrition diary that helps users track three interconnected aspects of their daily wellness: what they eat (Essgewohnheiten), symptoms they experience (Symptomerfassung), and medications they take (Medikamenteneinnahme). The app enables users to identify correlations between diet, symptoms, and medication effectiveness over time. The \"Tägliche Erfassung\" app serves as a combined daily entry point.\n\n### Who Uses This\nHealth-conscious individuals tracking their wellness journey - likely someone managing a chronic condition, food sensitivities, or working with a healthcare provider to understand symptom patterns. They want quick daily logging and the ability to spot trends.\n\n### The ONE Thing Users Care About Most\n**\"How am I feeling today compared to recent days?\"** - Users want an immediate snapshot of their current symptom status and whether things are improving or worsening. The symptom trend is the hero.\n\n### Primary Actions (IMPORTANT!)\n1. **Quick daily entry** → Primary Action Button (using Tägliche Erfassung)\n2. Log a specific symptom\n3. Record medication intake\n4. Add a meal entry\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Makes This Design Distinctive\n\n### Visual Identity\nA calming, wellness-focused aesthetic with a soft sage green accent on a warm off-white canvas. The design feels like a premium wellness app - serene but not clinical, personal but not juvenile. The green evokes natural health and balance without being cliché. Generous whitespace creates breathing room that reflects the app's purpose of mindful self-tracking.\n\n### Layout Strategy\n- **Hero element:** A large symptom wellness score/indicator that dominates the top of the viewport. This uses size (large typography), prominent positioning (top center), and ample whitespace to create clear visual hierarchy.\n- **Asymmetric layout on desktop:** Wide left column (70%) for primary content (hero + symptom chart), narrow right sidebar (30%) for quick actions and recent activity.\n- **Size variation:** The hero wellness indicator is dramatically larger than secondary KPIs (48px vs 14px supporting text). Secondary stats are compact inline badges, not cards.\n- **Typography creates rhythm:** Bold 600-weight numbers with light 300-weight labels creates visual interest without clutter.\n\n### Unique Element\nThe hero \"Wellness Score\" is displayed as a large number with a subtle colored background pill that shifts color based on the average symptom rating (green for good, amber for moderate, soft red for concerning). This creates an instant emotional read without requiring users to interpret numbers.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Theme & Colors\n\n### Font\n- **Family:** Plus Jakarta Sans\n- **URL:** `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Plus+Jakarta+Sans:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap`\n- **Why this font:** Plus Jakarta Sans has a warm, approachable character with excellent readability. It's professional enough for health data but friendly enough for daily personal use. The font has distinctive letter shapes that prevent it from feeling generic.\n\n### Color Palette\nAll colors as complete hsl() functions:\n\n| Purpose | Color | CSS Variable |\n|---------|-------|--------------|\n| Page background | `hsl(45 30% 97%)` | `--background` |\n| Main text | `hsl(200 15% 20%)` | `--foreground` |\n| Card background | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--card` |\n| Card text | `hsl(200 15% 20%)` | `--card-foreground` |\n| Borders | `hsl(45 15% 88%)` | `--border` |\n| Primary action | `hsl(152 35% 45%)` | `--primary` |\n| Text on primary | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| Accent highlight | `hsl(152 25% 94%)` | `--accent` |\n| Muted background | `hsl(45 20% 94%)` | `--muted` |\n| Muted text | `hsl(200 10% 50%)` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| Success/positive | `hsl(152 45% 42%)` | (component use) |\n| Warning/moderate | `hsl(38 70% 55%)` | (component use) |\n| Error/negative | `hsl(0 55% 55%)` | `--destructive` |\n\n### Why These Colors\nThe warm off-white background (slight cream undertone) creates a soft, inviting canvas that feels personal rather than clinical. The sage green primary evokes natural health and wellness without being the typical \"medical blue.\" The muted text color has a slight blue-gray that creates calm contrast. The warning amber and soft red are intentionally muted to avoid alarming users.\n\n### Background Treatment\nThe page background uses a warm off-white (`hsl(45 30% 97%)`) that gives the interface warmth. Cards are pure white to create subtle depth without heavy shadows. This creates a layered, calm aesthetic.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\nDesign mobile as a COMPLETELY SEPARATE experience, not squeezed desktop.\n\n### Layout Approach\nThe hero wellness indicator dominates the first viewport, creating an immediate emotional connection.

CSS Variables (Copy Exactly!)\n\nThe implementer MUST copy these values exactly into `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: hsl(45 30% 97%);\n  --foreground: hsl(200 15% 20%);\n  --card: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(200 15% 20%);\n  --popover: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(200 15% 20%);\n  --primary: hsl(152 35% 45%);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(0 0% 100%);\n  --secondary: hsl(45 20% 94%);\n  --secondary-foreground: hsl(200 15% 25%);\n  --muted: hsl(45 20% 94%);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(200 10% 50%);\n  --accent: hsl(152 25% 94%);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(152 35% 30%);\n  --destructive: hsl(0 55% 55%);\n  --border: hsl(45 15% 88%);\n  --input: hsl(45 15% 88%);\n  --ring: hsl(152 35% 45%);\n  --radius: 0.75rem;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. Implementation Checklist\n\nThe implementer should verify:\n- [ ] Font loaded from URL above (Plus Jakarta Sans with weights 300,400,500,600,700)\n- [ ] All CSS variables copied exactly\n- [ ] Mobile layout matches Section 4 (hero dominant, compact badges, fixed bottom button)\n- [ ] Desktop layout matches Section 5 (70/30 split, sticky sidebar)\n- [ ] Hero element is prominent as described (large number, colored background based on score)\n- [ ] Colors create the calm, wellness mood described in Section 2\n- [ ] Chart uses area fill with sage green color\n- [ ] Primary action button is always visible and prominent\n- [ ] Recent entries combine all data sources\n- [ ] Animations are subtle and performant\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}

Your ONLY job is to **implement exactly what design_brief.md describes**.\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Build a COMPLETE, PRODUCTION-READY Dashboard\n\n**This is not a prototype. This is not a demo. This is a production dashboard.**\n\nYou MUST:\n- **Implement EVERY feature** described in design_brief.md - do not skip anything\n- **Show ALL information** users need - no placeholder \"coming soon\" sections\n- **Primary action must work** - users can add/create from the dashboard\n- **Handle all states** - loading, empty, error states for every component\n- **Be ready for real users** - this goes live immediately after you build it\n\n**DO NOT:**\n- ❌ Skip features because they seem complex\n- ❌ Leave any section incomplete with \"TODO\" comments\n- ❌ Implement only the \"happy path\"\n- ❌ Create a read-only view when actions are needed\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL: You Do NOT Make Design Decisions\n\nAll design decisions are ALREADY MADE in `design_brief.md`. The designer wrote detailed instructions - follow them word for word.\n\n**Your job:**\n1. Read design_brief.md COMPLETELY\n2. Implement EXACTLY what it describes\n3. Do not deviate or \"improve\"\n\n**FORBIDDEN Actions:**\n- ❌ Choosing a different font than the brief specifies\n- ❌ Changing colors from the brief\n- ❌ Rearranging the layout differently than described\n- ❌ Adding components not mentioned in the brief\n- ❌ Using \"sensible defaults\" instead of what the brief says\n- ❌ Using Inter, Roboto, or system fonts (unless brief says so)\n- ❌ Interpreting the brief \"creatively\" - implement literally\n\n**The design_brief.md is written instructions from a designer. Follow them exactly.**\n\n---\n\n## Process\n\n### Step 1: Read the Design Brief COMPLETELY\n\n```bash\ncat design_brief.md\n```\n\nRead the ENTIRE brief carefully. Pay attention to:\n\n- **Section 3: Theme & Colors** → Font name, URL, and all color values\n- **Section 4: Mobile Layout** → Exact structure for phone screens\n- **Section 5: Desktop Layout** → Exact structure for computer screens\n- **Section 6: Components** → Hero KPI, secondary KPIs, charts, lists\n- **Section 7: Visual Details** → Border radius, shadows, animations\n- **Section 8: CSS Variables** → Copy these EXACTLY into src/index.css\n\nThe brief explains WHY decisions were made. This helps you understand intent, but your job is to implement what is written, not to interpret.\n\n### Step 2: Read Existing Code\n\n```bash\ncat src/types/*.ts\ncat src/services/livingAppsService.ts\n```\n\n### Step 3: Apply CSS Variables FIRST (CRITICAL!)\n\nBefore writing any React code, update the theme. Copy the CSS from **Section 8** of design_brief.md into `src/index.css`.\n\nshadcn/ui components use Tailwind CSS variables. If you don't update them, `<Card>`, `<Button>`, etc. will use **default colors** that don't match the design!\n\n```\ndesign_brief.md → src/index.css → Tailwind classes → shadcn components\n   (Section 8)      (CSS variables)   (bg-card, etc.)   (Card, Button)\n```\n\n#### Step 3a: Copy CSS Variables\n\nThe design_brief.md Section 8 contains ready-to-copy CSS. Copy it EXACTLY:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Copy ALL values from design_brief.md Section 8 */\n  --background: hsl(...);\n  --foreground: hsl(...);\n  /* etc. */\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3b: Light Mode (Always)\n\nThe design brief uses light mode. Make sure `index.html` does NOT have `class=\"dark\"`:\n\n```html\n<html lang=\"de\">  <!-- No \"dark\" class for light theme -->\n```\n\n### Step 4: Add Font\n\nCopy the font URL from **Section 3** of design_brief.md into `index.html`:\n\n```html\n<link href=\"[URL from Section 3]\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n### Step 5: Implement Dashboard.tsx\n\nNow implement the React component following the brief:\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Imports (always use 'import type' for types!)\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport type { AppType1, AppType2 } from '@/types/app';\nimport { LivingAppsService } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\n// 2. Follow Section 4 (Mobile) and Section 5 (Desktop) for layout\n// 3. Follow Section 6 for components (Hero, KPIs, Charts, Lists)\n// 4. Follow Section 7 for visual details (radius, shadows, animations)\n```\n\n### Step 6: Build and Deploy\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThen call `mcp__deploy_tools__deploy_to_github`\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Light mode defaults - used when NO .dark class */\n}\n\n.dark {\n  /* Dark mode - used when <html class=\"dark\"> */\n}\n```\n\n**Color Mapping Table:**\n\n| design_brief.md section | CSS Variable | Used by |\n|----------------------|--------------|---------|\n| `theme.colors.background` | `--background` | `bg-background`, body |\n| `theme.colors.foreground` | `--foreground` | `text-foreground`, body text |\n| `theme.colors.card` | `--card` | `<Card>` background |\n| `theme.colors.foreground` | `--card-foreground` | Text inside cards |\n| `theme.colors.primary` | `--primary` | `<Button>` default |\n| `theme.colors.accent` | `--accent` | Accent elements |\n| `theme.colors.muted` | `--muted` | Muted backgrounds |\n| `theme.colors.border` | `--border` | All borders |\n| `theme.colors.positive` | `--chart-2` | Success/positive in charts |\n| `theme.colors.negative` | `--destructive` | Error/negative |\n\n#### Step 4c: Example - Applying a Dark Theme\n\nIf design_brief.md says:\n```json\n{\n  \"theme\": {\n    \"mode\": \"dark\",\n    \"colors\": {\n      \"background\": \"hsl(215 28% 7%)\",\n      \"foreground\": \"hsl(215 10% 92%)\",\n      \"card\": \"hsl(215 25% 12%)\",\n      \"primary\": \"hsl(25 95% 53%)\",\n      \"accent\": \"hsl(173 80% 45%)\",\n      \"muted\": \"hsl(215 15% 20%)\",\n      \"border\": \"hsl(215 20% 18%)\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen update `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  --foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --card: hsl(215 25% 12%);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --popover: hsl(215 25% 12%);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --primary: hsl(25 95% 53%);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  \n  --accent: hsl(173 80% 45%);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  \n  --muted: hsl(215 15% 20%);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(215 10% 70%);\n  \n  --border: hsl(215 20% 18%);\n  --input: hsl(215 20% 18%);\n  --ring: hsl(173 80% 45%);\n}\n```\n\nAnd update `index.html`:\n```html\n<html lang=\"de\" class=\"dark\">\n```\n\n#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: CSS Color Format\n\nThe CSS variables **MUST use complete color functions**, not raw values!\n\n**❌ WRONG - Raw values break Tailwind:**\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: 220 25% 6%;        /* ❌ Just numbers - NOT a valid CSS color! */\n  --card: 220 20% 10%;             /* ❌ Browser ignores this, uses fallback! */\n}\n```\n\n**✅ CORRECT - Complete color functions:**\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: hsl(220 25% 6%);   /* ✓ Complete hsl() function */\n  --card: hsl(220 20% 10%);        /* ✓ Tailwind can use this */\n}\n```\n\n**Why raw values fail:**\n- Tailwind reads `var(--background)` directly for `bg-background`\n- If `--background` is `220 25% 6%` (just numbers), it's NOT a valid CSS color\n- Browser ignores invalid colors → falls back to white/transparent\n- Result: Light backgrounds with dark text = invisible!\n\n**Always copy the FULL hsl() function from design_brief.md Section 8, including the function name!**\n\n#### Why This Matters\n\nWithout this step:\n- `<Card>` uses default background (light/white)\n- Text colors (from design_brief) are for dark backgrounds\n- Result: **Light text on light cards = invisible!**\n\nWith this step:\n- All shadcn components automatically use your theme colors\n- Consistent look across all UI elements\n- No need to add inline styles everywhere\n\n### Step 5: Add Font from Spec\n\nIn `index.html`, add the font URL from design_brief.md Section 3:\n```html\n<link href=\"{font_url from spec}\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n### Step 6: Build and Test\n\n```bash\nnpm run build  # Must compile without errors\n```\n\n### Step 7: Deploy\n\n```\nCall mcp__deploy_tools__deploy_to_github\n```\n\n---\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### 1. Type Imports\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG\nimport { Workout } from '@/types/app';\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nimport type { Workout } from '@/types/app';\n```\n\n### 2. extractRecordId Always Has Null Check\n```typescript\nconst id = extractRecordId(record.fields.relation);\nif (!id) return;  // ✅ Always check!\n```\n\n### 3. Dates Without Seconds\n```typescript\n// For API: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM (no seconds!)\nconst dateForAPI = formData.date + 'T12:00';\n```\n\n### 4. Select Never Has Empty Value\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG\n<SelectItem value=\"\">None</SelectItem>\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\n<SelectItem value=\"none\">None</SelectItem>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\nBefore completing, verify EACH item against design_brief.md:\n\n### Theme Verification (CRITICAL!)\n- [ ] Font in `index.html` is EXACTLY from design_brief.md Section 3 (NOT Inter or Roboto!)\n- [ ] Font-family in CSS matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 3\n- [ ] `index.html` has NO \"dark\" class (light theme)\n- [ ] ALL CSS variables in `src/index.css` copied EXACTLY from design_brief.md Section 8\n- [ ] Colors are complete hsl() functions (not raw values)\n\n### Layout Verification\n- [ ] Mobile layout matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 4\n- [ ] Desktop layout matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 5\n- [ ] Hero element stands out as described\n- [ ] Section order matches the brief\n\n### Components Verification\n- [ ] Hero KPI matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6 \"Hero KPI\"\n- [ ] Secondary KPIs match EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6\n- [ ] Chart matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6 \"Chart\"\n- [ ] Primary action matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6\n\n### Visual Details Verification\n- [ ] Border radius matches design_brief.md Section 7\n- [ ] Shadow style matches design_brief.md Section 7\n- [ ] Animations match design_brief.md Section 7\n\n### Technical\n- [ ] `npm run build` passes\n- [ ] No console errors\n\n### ⚠️ COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION (CRITICAL!)\n\n**You MUST verify the dashboard is 100% complete before finishing:**\n\n- [ ] **Every app in app_metadata.json is used** - no data sources ignored\n- [ ] **Primary action works** (create new record via dialog/form)\n- [ ] **Data displays correctly** (all KPIs calculated, lists populated)\n- [ ] **All states handled:**\n  - [ ] Loading states for every data fetch\n  - [ ] Empty states with helpful guidance\n  - [ ] Error states with retry options\n- [ ] **Nothing is placeholder:**\n  - [ ] No \"TODO\" comments in code\n  - [ ] No \"Coming soon\" messages\n  - [ ] No hardcoded demo data\n\n**If ANY item above is unchecked, the dashboard is NOT complete. Fix it before deploying.**\n\n---\n\n## Definition of Done\n\nThe dashboard is complete when:\n\n1. ✅ **User experience excellent**: Intuitive, clear, professional\n2. ✅ **Primary action button works** (with Dialog/Modal)\n3. ✅ All KPIs/Stats calculated correctly\n4. ✅ Loading state works (Skeleton, not empty page)\n5. ✅ Error handling implemented (friendly messages)\n6. ✅ Empty state implemented (helpful placeholders)\n7. ✅ Responsive design (Mobile + Desktop)\n8. ✅ No TypeScript errors (`npm run build`)\n9. ✅ No console errors in browser\n10. ✅ Business logic correct\n11. ✅ Living Apps API rules followed (dates, applookup, response)\n12. ✅ **All features complete** - nothing skipped or left as TODO\n\n---\n\n## Drill-Down: When and How to Use It\n\nDrill-down is useful when there's **more information to show** than fits in the summary view. Don't add it everywhere - only where it adds value.\n\n### When to Use Drill-Down\n\n| Good Use Cases | Skip Drill-Down When... |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| List item → show full record details | The summary already shows everything |\n| Summary count → show the items being counted | It's a simple, self-explanatory number |\n| Record reference → view the related record | There's no additional detail to show |\n\n### Make It Obvious\n\nIf something is clickable, make it visually clear:\n- Hover effect (shadow, background change)\n- Cursor pointer\n- Underline or chevron icon for \"see more\"\n\n### Implementation Pattern: Clickable List Item\n\n```typescript\n// Use when list items have more details to show\n<div\n  className=\"p-3 rounded-lg hover:bg-muted cursor-pointer transition-colors\"\n  onClick={() => setSelectedRecord(record)}\n>\n  <div className=\"font-medium\">{record.name}</div>\n  <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">{record.summary}</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Don't force drill-down everywhere.** A simple KPI that shows \"5 workouts this week\" doesn't need a click handler if there's nothing more to show.\n\n---\n\n## UX Details - Don't Forget!\n\n### Loading States\n```typescript\nif (loading) {\n  return <LoadingState />;  // Use Skeleton, not spinner\n}\n```\n\n### Empty States\n```typescript\nif (data.length === 0) {\n  return (\n    <EmptyState \n      title=\"No data yet\"\n      description=\"Get started by adding your first item\"\n      action={<Button>Add First Item</Button>}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Error States\n```typescript\nif (error) {\n  return (\n    <Alert variant=\"destructive\">\n      <AlertCircle className=\"h-4 w-4\" />\n      <AlertTitle>Error</AlertTitle>\n      <AlertDescription>\n        {error.message}\n        <Button variant=\"outline\" onClick={retry}>Try Again</Button>\n      </AlertDescription>\n    </Alert>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Success Feedback\n```typescript\n// Use toast for success messages\nimport { toast } from '@/components/ui/use-toast';\n\ntoast({\n  title: \"Success!\",\n  description: \"Item saved successfully.\",\n});\n```\n\n### Hover States\n```typescript\n// Cards should have hover feedback\n<Card className=\"hover:shadow-md transition-shadow cursor-pointer\">\n```\n\n---\n\n# Living Apps API Reference\n\n## ⚠️ Critical API Rules\n\nThese rules are **non-negotiable**. Breaking them causes runtime errors.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Date Formats\n\nLiving Apps has strict date format requirements:\n\n| Field Type | Format | Example |\n|------------|--------|---------|\n| `date/datetimeminute` | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` | `2025-11-06T12:00` |\n| `date/date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `2025-11-06` |\n\n### ❌ WRONG\n```typescript\n// Seconds are NOT allowed for datetimeminute!\nconst date = '2025-11-06T12:00:00';  // ❌ Will fail\n```\n\n### ✅ CORRECT\n```typescript\n// For date/datetimeminute fields\nconst dateForAPI = formData.datum + 'T12:00';  // ✅ YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM\n\n// For date/date fields\nconst dateForAPI = formData.datum;  // ✅ YYYY-MM-DD\n\n// Display in <input type=\"date\">\nconst dateForInput = apiData.datum?.split('T')[0];  // Extract YYYY-MM-DD\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. applookup Fields\n\n`applookup/select` fields store **full URLs** to related records.\n\n### URL Format\n```\nhttps://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n```\n\n### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Always use extractRecordId()\n\n```typescript\n// ❌ NEVER do this manually\nconst parts = url.split('/');\nconst id = parts[parts.length - 1];  // ❌ Fragile!\n\n// ✅ ALWAYS use the helper function\nimport { extractRecordId } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\nconst recordId = extractRecordId(url);\nif (!recordId) return;  // ✅ Always null-check!\n```\n\n### extractRecordId() Implementation\n```typescript\nexport function extractRecordId(url: string | null | undefined): string | null {\n  if (!url) return null;\n  // Extracts last 24 hex characters (Living Apps Record IDs)\n  const match = url.match(/([a-f0-9]{24})$/i);\n  return match ? match[1] : null;\n}\n```\n\n### Creating applookup Values\n```typescript\nimport { createRecordUrl, APP_IDS } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\n// When creating/updating records with applookup fields\nconst data = {\n  kategorie: createRecordUrl(APP_IDS.KATEGORIEN, selectedKategorieId),\n};\n\n// createRecordUrl returns:\n// 'https://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}'\n```\n\n### applookup Can Be Null!\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG - Will crash if field is null\nworkoutLogs.forEach((log) => {\n  const id = extractRecordId(log.fields.uebung);\n  data[id] = log;  // ❌ Crashes if id is null\n});\n\n// ✅ CORRECT - Defensive programming\nworkoutLogs.forEach((log) => {\n  const id = extractRecordId(log.fields.uebung);\n  if (!id) return;  // ✅ Skip if null\n  if (!data[id]) data[id] = [];\n  data[id].push(log);\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. API Response Format\n\nLiving Apps returns **objects**, not arrays!\n\n### Response Structure\n```typescript\n// API returns:\n{\n  \"690abc123...\": {\n    \"createdat\": \"2025-11-06T10:00:00\",\n    \"updatedat\": null,\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"name\": \"Item 1\",\n      \"value\": 100\n    }\n  },\n  \"690def456...\": {\n    \"createdat\": \"2025-11-06T11:00:00\",\n    \"updatedat\": null,\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"name\": \"Item 2\",\n      \"value\": 200\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### ❌ WRONG Transformation\n```typescript\n// Loses record_id!\nconst items = Object.values(response);  // ❌ No record_id!\n```\n\n### ✅ CORRECT Transformation\n```typescript\n// Use Object.entries() to preserve record_id\nconst items = Object.entries(response).map(([record_id, record]) => ({\n  record_id,  // ← From the key\n  createdat: record.createdat,\n  updatedat: record.updatedat,\n  ...record.fields,\n}));\n```\n\n### Why record_id Matters\n- Required for React `key` prop\n- Required for update/delete operations\n- Required for applookup references\n\n---\n\n## 4. API Authentication\n\n```typescript\nconst headers = {\n  'X-API-Key': API_KEY,  // From environment\n  'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  'Accept': 'application/json',\n};\n```\n\n### Proxy vs Direct URL\n```typescript\n// For API calls (via proxy)\nconst API_BASE = '/api/rest';\n\n// For applookup values (direct)\nconst APPLOOKUP_BASE = 'https://my.living-apps.de/rest';\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. CRUD Operations\n\n### GET All Records\n```typescript\nGET /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records\n```\n\n### GET Single Record\n```typescript\nGET /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n```\n\n### CREATE Record\n```typescript\nPOST /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"New Item\",\n  \"value\": 100\n}\n```\n\n### UPDATE Record\n```typescript\nPATCH /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"value\": 150  // Only changed fields\n}\n```\n\n### DELETE Record\n```typescript\nDELETE /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n\n// Note: DELETE also returns JSON, always call response.json()\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Error Handling\n\n```typescript\nasync function callAPI(method: string, endpoint: string, data?: any) {\n  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}${endpoint}`, {\n    method,\n    headers: {\n      'X-API-Key': API_KEY,\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    },\n    body: data ? JSON.stringify(data) : undefined,\n  });\n\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    const errorText = await response.text();\n    throw new Error(`API Error (${response.status}): ${errorText}`);\n  }\n\n  return response.json();  // Always parse JSON, even for DELETE\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Metadata Structure\n\n`app_metadata.json` contains the **complete, real metadata from Living Apps REST API**.\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n- `controls` is an **OBJECT** (not array!)\n- Each control has `identifier`, `label`, `type`, `subtype`, `fulltype`\n- `lookup/select` has `lookup_data` with all options\n- `applookup/select` has `lookup_app` URL to the linked app\n\n```typescript\n{\n  \"appgroup_id\": \"...\",\n  \"appgroup_name\": \"My App Group\",\n  \"apps\": {\n    \"app_identifier\": {\n      \"app_id\": \"...\",\n      \"name\": \"App Display Name\",\n      \"controls\": {\n        \"control_identifier\": {\n          \"identifier\": \"field_name\",      // Use this as field key\n          \"label\": \"Field Label\",          // Use this for UI display\n          \"type\": \"string\",                // Base type\n          \"subtype\": null,                 // or \"select\", \"textarea\", etc.\n          \"fulltype\": \"string/text\",       // Combined: type/subtype\n          \"lookup_data\": [                 // For lookup/select fields\n            { \"key\": \"option1\", \"value\": \"Option 1\" },\n            { \"key\": \"option2\", \"value\": \"Option 2\" }\n          ],\n          \"lookup_app\": \"https://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}\"  // For applookup\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Common Field Types\n| fulltype | TypeScript | Notes |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| `string/text` | `string` | Plain text |\n| `string/textarea` | `string` | Multiline text |\n| `number/number` | `number` | Numeric |\n| `bool/bool` | `boolean` | True/false |\n| `date/date` | `string` | YYYY-MM-DD |\n| `date/datetimeminute` | `string` | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM (NO seconds!) |\n| `lookup/select` | `string` | From predefined list (lookup_data) |\n| `applookup/select` | `string \\| null` | URL to another app's record |\n\n### Using Metadata for UI\n```typescript\n// Use field labels for UI\nconst fieldLabel = metadata.apps.myapp.controls.myfield.label;\n\n// Use lookup_data for Select options\nconst options = metadata.apps.myapp.controls.status.lookup_data;\n// → [{ key: \"active\", value: \"Active\" }, { key: \"done\", value: \"Done\" }]\n```\n\n---\n\n# Code Patterns Reference\n\n## Available Libraries\n\n### shadcn/ui Components\n\nAll shadcn components are pre-installed in `/src/components/ui/`\n\n```typescript\nimport { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '@/components/ui/card';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport { Badge } from '@/components/ui/badge';\nimport { Input } from '@/components/ui/input';\nimport { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';\nimport { Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogTrigger } from '@/components/ui/dialog';\nimport { Table, TableBody, TableCell, TableHead, TableHeader, TableRow } from '@/components/ui/table';\nimport { Skeleton } from '@/components/ui/skeleton';\nimport { Alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle } from '@/components/ui/alert';\n// etc.\n```\n\n**To find specific components or examples, use shadcn MCP Tools:**\n```\nmcp_shadcn_search_items_in_registries(registries: ['@shadcn'], query: 'chart')\nmcp_shadcn_view_items_in_registries(items: ['@shadcn/card'])\nmcp_shadcn_get_item_examples_from_registries(registries: ['@shadcn'], query: 'card-demo')\n```\n\n### recharts (Charts)\n\nPre-installed!
